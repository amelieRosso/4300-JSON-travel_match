The centrepiece of the park is the South Nahanni River (Naha Deh\u00e9). Four noteworthy canyons reaching 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in depth, called First, Second, Third and Fourth Canyon, line its whitewater river.The park was among the world's first four natural heritage locations to be inscribed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1978 because of its picturesque wild rivers, canyons, and waterfalls.\n\nThe park's sulphur hot springs, alpine tundra, mountain ranges, and forests of spruce and aspen are home to many species of birds, fish and mammals. The park lies within three of Canada's ecozones, the Taiga Cordillera in the west, the Taiga Plains in the east and a small southern portion in the Boreal Cordillera.\n\nAccording to Parks Canada, there are about 42 mammal species in the park, in addition to around 180 types of bird, 16 fishes and a few hardy amphibians, with the wood frog being the most commonly-found in the region.In the State of the Park Report 2009, the NWT government named ten special-concern, threatened, or endangered species that the Nahanni National Park Reserve provides appropriate year-round or seasonal habitat for, according to the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). These include the common nighthawk, grizzly bear, olive-sided flycatcher, peregrine falcon, rusty blackbird, short-eared owl, wood bison, woodland caribou, wolverine and yellow rail. In addition, the bull trout and the Nahanni aster are listed, but without status; the Canada warbler and western toad are listed as possibly existing in the park.\n\nMammal species found in the park include the American black bear, American mink, beaver, Arctic ground squirrel, Canada lynx, collared pika, Dall sheep, fisher, grey wolf, hoary bat, hoary marmot, least chipmunk, least weasel, moose, muskrat, northern myotis, mule deer, pine marten, red fox, red squirrel, river otter, Rocky Mountain goat, snowshoe hare, white-tailed deer and several types of shrew and vole.\n\nBirds are numerous, and include American kestrel, bald and golden eagles, barred owl, belted kingfisher, boreal owl, black-capped and boreal chickadees, Canada goose, Canada jay, eared grebe, great grey owl, great horned owl, grouse, gulls, gyrfalcon, harlequin ducks, horned grebe, loons (the common, Pacific, red-throated and yellow-billed), mallards, northern harrier, northern shrike, osprey, pied-billed grebe, ptarmigan, redpoll, red-necked grebe, red phalarope, sandpipers and plovers, sharp-shinned hawk, snow goose, surf scoter, swallows, woodpeckers and sapsuckers, and trumpeter and tundra swans.It also includes the only known nesting site of the whooping crane.\n\nFish found in the park include, Arctic grayling, burbot, inconnu, lake trout, lake chub, lake whitefish, longnose dace, longnose sucker, mountain whitefish, northern pike, round whitefish, slimy sculpin, spoonhead sculpin, spottail shiner and trout-perch.\n\nThe diverse range of soils offers several specialized and uncommon habitats. More than 700 species of vascular plants and 300 species of both bryophytes and lichen can be found in the park, giving it a richer variety than any other area in the NWT. Nahanni aster is a very rare species of aster found only in the Park.",

Leave at least one day free to get to know the local beaches and people a little bit better. The tours consume a lot of energy and time and, although they are worth it, they prevent you from digging a little bit deeper into the local culture. Make sure to eat where the locals eat. The food will be tasty and not as expensive and you will get the experience of sharing a meal with people from the islands. When going from one Island to another, make sure that you take one of the sea sickness pills. The ride is very bumpy and the boat tilts and rolls quite a lot. If you are not used to this kind of motion, you will get nausea. If you have never snorkeled, I recommend you practice at your local pool before trying it for the first time during the tour. Don't underestimate the mechanics of breathing through the tube. Finally, since for most people this is a once in a lifetime experience, I recommend bringing good photographic equipment. You should have at least one good underwater camera and a relatively portable camera where you can exchange lenses. I do not recommend bringing large cameras. They will weigh you down on the long walks and they will be a constant source of worry given the sand and water. In short, just enjoy the wonderful experience of the Galapago Islands.",

In some rooms, it can be a bit difficult to hear everything or take the time to ask more questions, as the next group is already waiting. However, with the amount of walking and moving between monuments, there are definitely opportunities to ask questions along the way.\n\nI highly recommend visiting this iconic site.

        "text": "\u00cele de Gor\u00e9e, located off the coast of Dakar, Senegal, is a place of profound historical significance and natural beauty. Visiting this island was a deeply moving experience, blending solemn history with a picturesque setting.\n\nThe island is most renowned for its role in the transatlantic slave trade. The Maison des Esclaves (House of Slaves) is a stark reminder of this dark chapter in history. Walking through its narrow corridors and seeing the infamous Door of No Return, where countless enslaved Africans passed before being shipped off to the Americas, was a powerful and emotional experience. The museum provides a poignant and educational journey, emphasizing the importance of remembering and learning from the past.\n\nDespite its tragic history, Gor\u00e9e is also a place of incredible beauty. The island is small, easily walkable, and boasts charming colonial architecture with colorful buildings draped in bougainvillea. The streets are narrow and often cobblestoned, giving a sense of stepping back in time. The peaceful atmosphere is a stark contrast to the bustling city of Dakar, making it a perfect day trip for those looking to escape the city's hustle and bustle.\n\nThe island offers several small cafes and restaurants where you can enjoy local cuisine while taking in the views of the Atlantic Ocean. The beaches are small but serene, ideal for a relaxing afternoon. Artisans on the island sell a variety of crafts, paintings, and souvenirs, providing an opportunity to take home a piece of Senegalese culture.\n\nClimbing to the top of the island provides panoramic views of Dakar and the surrounding sea, making it a favorite spot for photographers. The island's vibrant community and lively atmosphere add to its charm, making it more than just a historical site but also a living, breathing part of Senegalese culture.\n\nIn conclusion, \u00cele de Gor\u00e9e is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Senegal. It offers a unique blend of historical education, natural beauty, and cultural richness. The island serves as a powerful reminder of humanity's past while also showcasing the resilience and beauty of Senegalese culture. Whether you're a history buff, a nature lover, or simply looking for a peaceful retreat, Gor\u00e9e has something to offer.",

It's got a huge car park for \u20ac10 payable at the exit barrier which is good considering the shuttle bus is free. It's a long walk but the buses go pretty much to the end of the causeway then the driver gets out and goes to the other end of the bus as there's a cab at the front and back, then it's driven to the right lane for the journey back. It's quite small on the island and a lot of people on a February Wednesday I really wouldn't like to come in August.",

However, we quickly found a side path and climbed away from the crowds and were alone almost immediately, We were able to wander the back stair cases and pathways  following an alternate route to the Abbey entrance.  I am sure we missed at least a few of the many paths (back streets) leading all of the place. We got to see fascinating little nooks and crannies and views of the village, as well as avoiding the masses of people that visit every day. There are a lot of stairs, but I would recommend side tracking.",

As well as being quiet, they were also nicely misty over the many ornamental ponds and lakes, although the fountains were not active. We were surprised at both the scale of the gardens and how \"high rise\" they were. On scale, plan on giving them at least a couple of hours - and even more if you're \"completist\" about these things. On \"high rise\", from satellite views, we'd assumed they were full of ornamental plants of mostly bush height. Instead, the privacy of the gardens is enhanced by trees and hedges breaking them into nicely isolated \"blocks\". It's only really immediately near the palace that the low height formal gardens that we'd expected predominated. We didn't visit the palace, but the gardens will be enough for most people - the enormous queues we saw for the former would also recommend in their favour! I should add that you probably need to be comfortable walking (and in comfortable walking shoes) to get the most out of them. They're also not flat, with a hill up to the palace site.

In the Lori language, Chagha means hill and basket means basket. This ziggurat is the central building of the ancient site left from the Elamite complex Duravantash (Ontash city), which is located near Shush in Khuzestan province.  In 1979, Chaghazenbil was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the first historical monument from Iran, and its unique architecture, along with the ziggurats discovered in the middle of Rhodan, is known to archaeologists and those interested in history and world cultural heritage. Orientalists consider Chaghazanbil to be the oldest known religious building in Iran\n\nIn 1890, the famous geologist Jacques de Morgan reported that there are oil mines in Chaghazanbil area.  It seems that Iran Oil Company was founded after this report.  After fifty years, engineers who were engaged in oil activities in Chaghazanbil found a brick with writings on it.  The brick was sent to the archaeologists who were excavating in Susa, and after that a chain of excavations took place in Chaghazanbil, which led to the discovery of Chaghazanbil Temple and other important works.\n\nThis building was first discovered by \"Brown\" Boraven, a New Zealand expert of Iran and England Oil Company in 1936 [source required] and was excavated by Roman Girshman between 1953 and 1963.\n\nFor many centuries, this building was buried under the soil in the form of an overturned basket until it was excavated by the French Roman Girshman during the Pahlavi II era.  Although the excavation of this symmetrical convex building located in the heart of the Saf plain completed the world's knowledge about the ancient history of Iranians, but after about 50 years of this discovery, leaving this building in the hands of natural erosive factors and defenseless against them caused many damages.  into this clay-mud building and especially the remnants of the upper floors have suffered severe erosion that if immediate basic protection and maintenance measures are not taken for this precious work, its destruction will accelerate and it will turn into a pile of mud in the coming decades.  will be",

This remarkable archeological site, dating back to the fifth century BCE, provides insight into the majesty and sophistication of one of the world's first major civilizations.\n\nPersepolis, built on a large terrace cut into a mountain, was designed by Darius the Great as a great capital to represent his empire's unity and variety. The name Persepolis comes from the Greek words \"Persis,\" meaning Persia, and \"polis,\" meaning city. In Persian, it is known as \"Takht-e Jamshid,\" which translates to \"Throne of Jamshid,\" after a mythical Persian ruler.\n\nPersepolis' architecture is a masterpiece of engineering and craftsmanship. The gigantic stone columns, complex carvings, and monumental staircases showcase the Achaemenid architects' skill and ingenuity. Some of the most significant aspects of Persepolis are:\n\nThe Apadana Palace, located in the middle of Persepolis, served as a large hall for royal gatherings and events. Its massive columns and elaborate reliefs showing topics from around the empire are especially striking.\nTreasury: This structure was used to house the royal treasury. Its robust structure and concealed entry indicate that it was intended to preserve important belongings.\nThe Gate of All Nations is a massive entrance embellished with reliefs portraying representatives from various regions of the empire, signifying the Achaemenid realm's unity.\nHall of Hundred Columns: This massive hall, with its 100 towering columns, was utilized for royal feasts and festivities.\n\nAlexander the Great destroyed Persepolis in 330 BCE, yet the remains have remained for centuries. European visitors rediscovered the monument in the 17th century, and it has subsequently been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today, travelers from all over the world flock to admire the historic city's grandeur and beauty.",

Now in ruins, in the 11th century, it served as the first capital of the Hammadid dynasty. It is in the Hodna Mountains northeast of M'Sila, at an elevation of 1,418 metres (4,652 ft), and receives abundant water from the surrounding mountains. Beni Hammad Fort is near the town of Maadid (aka Maadhid), about 225 kilometres (140 mi) southeast of Algiers, in the Maghreb.\n\nIn 1980, it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and described as \"an authentic picture of a fortified Muslim city\".\n\nThe town includes a 7-kilometre (4 mi) long line of walls. Inside the walls are four residential complexes, and the largest mosque built in Algeria after that of Mansurah. It is similar in design to the Grand Mosque of Kairouan, with a tall minaret, 20 metres (66 ft).\n\nExcavations have brought to light numerous terracotta, jewels, coins and ceramics testifying to the high level of civilization under the Hammadid dynasty. Also among the artifacts discovered are several decorative fountains using the lion as a motif. The remains of the emir's palace, known as Dal al-Bahr, include three separate residences separated by gardens and pavilions.\nThe fortress was built in 1007 by Hammad ibn Buluggin, the son of Buluggin ibn Ziri, the founder of Algiers. The city became the capital of the Hammadid Berbers, and sustained a siege from the Zirid in 1017.

They helped her especially, which was very nice of them. When we saw the gorillas they did all they could for us to get good pictures and see all of them. They really made the experience extremely worthwhile.\n\nI 100% recommend going here. I felt super safe and cared for. I love how the rangers here care a lot for their gorillas and the people who come to see them.",

It had two 2\ufe0f\u20e3 buildings, one to house troops and the other a chapel. The priests wanted to build a church and convent and in 1463, they started construction. The main parts of the convent were completed in 1469, whereas the church was finished in 1482. Local materials were used to construct the building. Inside the church, there are seven 7\ufe0f\u20e3 chapels along each of the side aisles and were used by the most important families in Milan for burial and private prayer.\nThe convent contains the mural of \u2018The Last Supper\u2019 by Leonardo da Vinci which is in the refectory.\nThis UNESCO World Heritage listed building is a MUST when visiting Milan.

This ancient temple complex offers an incredible glimpse into Malta\u2019s prehistoric past and is complemented by the nearby Mnajdra ruins, making it a captivating excursion for anyone intrigued by ancient civilisations.\n\nHa\u0121ar Qim, dating back over 5,000 years, is perched atop a promontory with stunning views of the surrounding landscape. To the east lies a fertile plain, while to the west, the rugged garrigue slopes gently down towards the sea. This UNESCO World Heritage Site was not built for habitation but served as a temple dedicated to worship. Among its remarkable discoveries were statues believed to be connected to fertility rites, showcasing the spiritual and cultural significance of the site. Some of these artefacts are now exhibited at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta.\n\nA short 500-metre walk downhill from Ha\u0121ar Qim, the Mnajdra ruins await. These contemporary structures are thought to have been used by the same community due to their close proximity. Both sites share architectural similarities that underline the sophistication of the Neolithic builders.\n\nWe visited Ha\u0121ar Qim in December 2024, and it was a delightfully sunny day with temperatures hovering around 17\u00b0C. The weather added to the experience, making it comfortable to explore the site without being overwhelmed by heat. The ruins themselves are relatively small, and it doesn\u2019t take long to walk around, but the history they encapsulate is nothing short of mind-boggling.\n\nHaving seen a documentary on Ha\u0121ar Qim, I had long been fascinated by how the Neolithic builders managed to construct these temples using massive stone blocks thousands of years ago. Standing in front of these ancient structures and imagining the sheer effort and ingenuity required to erect them was an awe-inspiring experience.\n\nPractical Information\nTickets are easily available at the museum entrance, and one ticket covers both Ha\u0121ar Qim and Mnajdra, making it excellent value for money. Upon entry, you can download a free audio commentary, which is available in multiple languages. This adds depth to the experience, offering detailed insights into the history and significance of the sites.\n\nBefore heading to the temples, you can also visit the on-site museum, which provides additional context about the ruins, their purpose, and the people who built them. The museum is a great starting point to fully appreciate what you\u2019re about to see.\n\nHa\u0121ar Qim is more than just an archaeological site\u2014it\u2019s a window into an ancient world. Whether you\u2019re a history buff or simply someone who enjoys marvelling at the ingenuity of our ancestors, a visit to Ha\u0121ar Qim and Mnajdra is bound to leave a lasting impression. The serene setting, coupled with the fascinating history, makes this an unforgettable experience.\n\nIf you're planning to visit, consider setting aside about 2-3 hours to take in both sites and the surrounding natural beauty. Don\u2019t forget your camera\u2014you\u2019ll want to capture the spectacular views as well as the temples themselves!",

Unfortunately, the heavy rainfall earlier in the day created rivers blocking parts of the path, so I couldn\u2019t go the full distance. However, even with this setback, the experience was unforgettable. I also took a short detour to drive through the Avenue of Giants, which was absolutely worth it!\n\nI traveled from the Bay Area, which took about 7-8 hours with charging stops.

There is a free shuttle to the beginning of the walkways where there is a small restaurant bathrooms and all of the walkways going down? There\u2019s also a parking area there with plenty of parking for us as a single car. There is also because the glacier comes up against land at the end of a peninsula there\u2019s a right and a left view there plus a view of the whole glacier that boat ride from that point only does the right hand side, but I don\u2019t think it makes any difference",

They had some gardens which housed a variety of natural grasses and plants from wild juniper and sage.

They had many exhibits on the Blackfoot people and part of the cultural and the  after settlers arrived and what they brought.

There is a shuttle service available that takes you to a couple of notable tombs. However in my opinion I don't think it's worth it as it only covers a tiny portion of the graveyard and costs 1000 rupees to book. Many tombs inside are being restored and the site is UNESCO protected. Some tombs have an entrance fee to go inside and some are locked for the public, while the costs can add up I think the measure is necessary to keep troublemakers away.

The site is very well managed and adequately staffed that has kept it in a clean and visit worthy condition. Also ample signage has been displayed at various locations across the garden to facilitate visitors. The gardens are located on the GT road traveling east towards Wahga Border, the site is easily accessible via public transport in terms of orange line metro train.\n\nLayout: The main entrance on GT Road leads to a paid parking lot where Rs. 100 is charged for parking fee. From there you proceed to the entrance where a ticket needs to be purchased for both adults and children at Rs. 30 for Pakistani Nationals and Rs. 500 for foreigners. The entrance to the gardens is through a metal detector walk through gate ensuring safety of the visitors.\n\nGardens: The gardens are located at 200 meter walk from the entrance, into a courtyard type setting. The gardens have a unique structure with fountains and paths in the middle and square plot gardens on either side. Further down the pathway, there is another set of gardens, that are the most beautiful in the entire park with a large square pond in the middle, and viewing structures on either side.\n\nTime Required: It will take approximately two hours to visit the entire compound without rushing as well as reading up on the history.\n\nCrowd: There will be both local rowdy crowd as well as decent crowd interested to learn more about the historic location. The best part is that there is ample security staff around the entire complex to make sure the visitors get the best experience.\n\nFood and Snacks: There are quite a few snacks stalls selling small snack items including chips and popcorn as well as drinks.\n\nAccessibility: There is a lot of walking involved, and quite a few steps to be taken. There are golf carts available for hire, which can somewhat facilitate the visitors with mobility challenges.\n\nThis place is popular for many private events as well, that usually take place after the park closing hours in the evening.",

This extensive jungle features endless virgin rainforests, premontane and montane forests, cloud forests and dwarf forests, as well as large mangroves. You\u2019ll also find meandering rivers such as the Tuira or the Chucunaque, an astounding array of unique wildlife, including the jaguar and the harpy eagle, plus mountain ranges that reach more than 2,500 meters in elevation. As one of the most important UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Central America, Darien is a Biosphere Reserve and the focus of many conservation efforts in Panam\u00e1. In fact, after the Amazon rainforest, Darien National Park is considered the most important \u201cnatural lung\u201d in the Americas.\n\nRecommended for true adventurers only, the park is rainy, humid and extremely remote, with two popular areas to visit. One of them is Santa Cruz de Cana, or Cana. Located in the middle of the park along the eastern slope of Cerro Pirre (or Pirre Hill), the area was once a mining town where the Spanish discovered gold in 1665. Today, it\u2019s one of the most pristine outdoor areas in Panam\u00e1, and among the top locations in the country for birdwatching. Look out for colorful macaws, tanagers, manakins, eagles and hummingbirds, as well as other wildlife such as howler and spider monkeys, white-lipped peccaries and Baird\u2019s Tapirs. Explore the jungle on one of five hiking trails in the area, which offer views of the forest and the old mining operations.\n\nOn the other side of Cerro Pirre, you\u2019ll find Pirre Station\u2014another hiking destination inside the great jungle. Also known as Rancho Fr\u00edo, this area is replete with lush nature and an abundance of wildlife that includes woodpeckers, monkeys, tamarins and sloths. When you get to Pirre Station, you\u2019ll find a basic dormitory, outhouse and kitchen, but you\u2019ll have to bring your own gear for sleeping and eating.",

Before entering the park, the guide made us wait 20-30 minutes because supposedly the boats were occupied, but in reality he was just waiting for other tourists to guide as well and double his earnings (understandable, but then dont make up a fake reason for us to wait). It would make more sense if the guide was shared across the entire boat (with the guide fee then included in the boat ticket). The boat has a loud (!) petrol engine. For the insane price of 38k for a 2 hour park visit, they would do well to invest in a quiet electric engine that doesnt scare away half the wildlife.

        "text": "Lots of different opinions about the Niokolo-Koba National Park - here is a well-informed review which should help.\n\nI have visited the park 4 times in the last 5 years, staying a few nights each time. It seems that most of the negative reviews are based off unrealistic expectations and standards. Personally, I love going there. Understanding the following should help with having a successful trip.\n\n1. This is no East Africa. Those who are expecting Kenya/Tanzania standards of safari will be disappointed (both in terms of level of service and density of wildlife). The environment is more forest/woodland than grassland savanna, but with a beautiful river running through the heart of the park. The park is also under-funded by the government.\n\n2. As a national park with very limited commercialisation, you can benefit from really being alone in nature, hardly ever crossing another vehicle during a multi-day stay. Sleep quality is amazing and the sounds of nature are abundant.\n\n3. There ARE lions, leopards and hyenas in the park. I have seen them. But the park is vast and there are not very many of them. You have to be lucky to spot them, and shouldn't expect to find them on a single day-visit. Staying a few nights increases your chances. In any case, it is 'almost' guaranteed that you will see various antelope species, warthogs, lots of birds, baboons, monkeys and hippos. There are also buffalo, tortoises, marmots and many more nocturnal creatures.\n\n4. Those who complain about the prices have clearly never been to East Africa where a standard safari experience can easily run into a 2000-5000\u20ac bill. The Niokolo-Koba is a bargain in comparison.\n\n5. Go between December and May. March-May will be best for visibility and density of animals as the forest will be dry and only a few watering holes will still be present. Going outside these months would be counterproductive as the vegetation will be thick from wet-season and animals will be more spread out as more water is available. This principle is the same all over the world.\n\n6. The guides are friendly, but poorly trained and equipped. Don't expect much from them apart from answering basic questions and helping you not get lost if self-driving. They also don't speak English. Absolutely bring your own Binoculars, or resolve to renting for 8\u20ac a day per unit.\n\n7. Do the boat-safari to spot wildlife along the river. This is definitely a highlight. Ask your guide in advance to organise this for you.\n\nFinally, here are my personal recommendations to have a great time.\n\nLower your expectations. Look forward to spending time in off-grid nature with little people around. Bring your own good vehicle, a 4x4 helps but not mandatory. At least something with good ground clearance and big windows. Stay at least two nights to settle into the environment. Stay at the \"Campement du Lion\". It's cheap, very basic and authentic. Bring your own canned and dry food and drinks as the meals they offer are not worth it in my opinion. You can leave your drinks in their large fridge for free. The alternative is spending 150\u20ac a night per person at the luxurious Nioko-Lodge. Tremendous accommodation, with 3 meals a day included, but a totally different budget. You can also just go there for lunch as a visitor and enjoy the stunning view from the restaurant. Enjoy the game drives and be grateful to see the animals!",

I work often in forests, etc... and, opposite to people's expectations, it's usually difficult to see animals. Obviously, they try to avoid humans, so you need to stay for some days to see animals. Surprisingly, we saw around 20 bird species, African boars, mongoos, baboons, green monkeys, antelopes, cocodriles, hippos, termite nests, lizards, beautiful ants... altogether accompanied by a beautiful landscape. I can't deny that it's the dry season, so animals tend to go to the water to drink and refresh, and it helps a lot. Although, if you are not use to high temperatures, you have to consider to come during this season. We spent the day with an excellent driver and a wonderful guide (Blaise) that we met at the Camp chez Ibrahim (right at the entrance to the park), a calm and comfortable place managed by a wonderful family. We are leaving the place very thankful for this very wonderful experience.",

Some are a little bit less accessible than others with the 8 hr trek up Mt Gower (900m+ above sea level) requiring a guide,running only when the weather is a little kinder than some of these photos show.\nThen there's the prerequisite cycle. The only way tourists gad about the very short distances to ride (but sometimes are a little too far to walk). Hired usually the day you arrive except Saturday's which is when the outside of resort options are closed (no exceptions). You can hit the beaches, go swimming, snorkeling, surfing, fishing, scuba diving, etc... there's boat tours out to Balls pyramid, around the island, and in the lagoon to watch the turtles, down to Ned's beach to feed the fish (fish food, not bread!), And then there's the local haunts for breakfast, morning tea, afternoon tea, pre-dinner cocktails and dinner, with each resort providing transport too, and the venue usually providing transport from, or you can walk (umbrellas come with the units) & most also provide torches, an absolute necessity for night travel without a car! There are no real street lights, and dusk falls quickly and completely sans full moon.\nThe island has the usual provision issues, so if you're after all of the products provided on the mainland then you may fall a little short, & not find all you are after. The supermarkets or stores, provide the basic necessities and be prepared for transport costs being factored in to the cost (as is quite reasonable). Fresh milk is not as accessible as UHT milk, and is quite tricksy to transport, also to be expected. The restaurants provide excellent meals, and the daily baked muffins at the Anchorage are to die for (& can last for more than one snack!)\nTo say we're fans is an understatement, we will be going again, and can't wait to see the island again (I know, we just left, but could happily work there for a season or two), wonder if they'll ever open a high school?\nIf the opportunity arises, then splurge out, fly out from Sydney, Newcastle or Goldcoast, and enjoy the short 1hr 45 min flight (unless of course the weather is recalcitrant and the plane can't land or is cancelled before it flies...travel insurance solves that issue).",

Our guide helped us get the tickets and walked us through the gardens before we started the climb. It was quite busy and It is recommended to come early morning\n\nThe climb to the top took us around 35-40 minutes. It\u2019s a bit of a workout, but totally worth it. Once you get to the top, the views are absolutely breathtaking, and the remains of the old fort or palace are really interesting to explore. We spent some time taking lots of photos of the incredible views before heading back down.\n\nThe descent was quicker, about 30 minutes, and there are some small shops at the end where you can grab a drink or snack if you need to.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to visit, I\u2019d definitely recommend taking plenty of water because the climb can be tiring. Don\u2019t bother bringing snacks, though \u2013 the monkeys are everywhere, and they\u2019ll grab anything they can! Also, don\u2019t forget a good camera or your phone to capture the views\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a must-visit if you\u2019re in the area. The history, the views, and the whole experience of climbing the rock made it an unforgettable day for us. Highly recommend it!",

The moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the stunning Rococo architecture and the intricate details of the interior. The lavish decorations, the vibrant frescoes, and the serene ambiance all combined to create a sense of peace and reverence.\n\nOne of the most memorable aspects of my visit was the sense of tranquility that enveloped me as I walked through the church. It\u2019s a place that invites reflection and contemplation, making it not just a visual feast but a spiritual retreat as well. The pastoral setting adds to the charm, with the lush green meadows and the picturesque mountains providing a perfect backdrop to this sacred site.\n\nWhat also stood out to me was the warm welcome from the local community. Their pride in the church and its history was evident, and their hospitality made the visit even more special. If you have the chance to visit the Pilgrimage Church of Wies, take the time to explore its surroundings as well. The peaceful walks and the chance to connect with nature make for a holistic and enriching experience.\n\nThe Pilgrimage Church of Wies is not just a destination for those interested in religious sites or art. It\u2019s a haven of beauty and serenity that touches the soul and leaves a lasting impression. A must-see for anyone traveling through Bavaria!",

The views were absolutely unreal\u2014towering mountains, lush green valleys, and winding roads that made the descent both thrilling and surreal.\n\nAfter spending the night in a small town near Hidroel\u00e9ctrica, we were up early for the next leg of our adventure\u2014ziplining through the mountains! The 45-minute ziplining experience was exhilarating, offering a bird\u2019s-eye view of the vast landscape. Just when we thought it couldn\u2019t get any better, we headed to a river for white-water rafting. The rapids were thrilling but manageable, making it a perfect mix of excitement and fun.\n\nThroughout the trip, meals were provided, keeping us fueled for the journey. On the third morning, we met with our guide for a 4-hour trek to Aguas Calientes, the base town for Machu Picchu. After arriving, we purchased our Machu Picchu tickets in person, which must be done in advance\u2014an important tip for future travelers.\n\nThe next morning was the moment we had been waiting for. We took the bus up to Machu Picchu, where we hired a guide to take us through the incredible ruins. Standing among the ancient Incan city, surrounded by mist-covered mountains, was beyond words. The history, the energy, and the sheer beauty of Machu Picchu made every step of the journey worth it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an adventure-packed, unforgettable way to experience Machu Picchu, this 3-day trek is the way to do it!",

They are like an inverse image of the Mayan Tikal complex in Guatemala. There is a depth, beauty, and mystique here. You can almost sense the priests walking to and fro on the grounds.  Also, Ricardo, an employee on the grounds, is a very warm and engaging man who was a pleasure to chat with before and after my tour of the site.

We bought our tickets online, so we got in quickly with barely any wait. The park opens at 8 am, so we got there right when it opened, and many of the trails were empty. The Devil\u2019s Throat area is the most crowded, but the trails leading up to it are quieter. Seeing the falls and the surrounding jungle is an experience like no other. You could easily spend 8-9 hours here. Make sure to bring plenty of water if you\u2019re hiking. If you only have one day, I highly recommend this side of the falls.

I wore leggings, a t-shirt, and a heavy fleece jacket with a beanie and it was enough to keep me warm! Wear layers so you can peel off as you hike. We wore trail runners and those were adequate for hiking. We stayed in Canmore and drove into Banff, which really wasn\u2019t too far.\n\n*NOTE: Get a bus pass to Moraine Lake and Lake Louise. We weren\u2019t able to get the Parks Canada shuttle, so we went with a private company, Fairview Limousine Shuttle. It was CA$25 for Lake Louise and CA$35 for Moraine Lake per person, but if you wanted to do sunrise, it was like 3x the price. We did the shuttle to Moraine Lake at 7:15 am, so we got there just after sunrise, at 7:45. It was so cloudy that day that being there for sunrise wouldn\u2019t have been worth it anyway.\n\nThursday, 9/19\n- Peyto Lake (.8 miles total) - Got there at 1:30 pm, there were enough parking spots. Took less than 30 minutes total, including stopping for pics. Stay on the trail! The trees are incredible and smell amazing!! Absolutely stunning views. They have toilets with no running water in the parking lot.\n- Bow Lake - Walked around a bit, didn\u2019t really hike. We heard there\u2019s a nice hike, which we would\u2019ve done if we hadn\u2019t started so late in the day!\n- Mistaya Canyon (.7 miles total) - Took 20 minutes, pretty!!\n\nFriday, 9/20\n- Johnston Canyon to Upper Falls (3.4 miles total) - Got there at 8 am on a rainy and cold day, so there was plenty of parking. By the time we got down at 10:40, parking lot was full. Bathrooms with running water at the start. Because it was rainy and cold, the trail was almost empty. Very pretty! Took us a little over 2 hours, including stopping for lunch. We would\u2019ve loved to do Ink Pots, but the toddler was cranky.\n- Emerald Lake in Yoho National Park - Got there at noon and it was packed, had to park far away. Stroller-friendly boardwalk. Amazing views. Little cafe and bathrooms without running water. We were there for about 30 minutes, but there are plenty of trails if you choose to hike!\n- Natural Bridge - Got there at 1 pm, found a parking spot. Bathrooms without running water. Quick stop, very cool.\n\nSaturday, 9/21\n- Tunnel Mountain Summit from Upper Parking Lot (2.6 miles total) - At 8:45 am, plenty of parking. Very cold\u2014below freezing. Took us 50 minutes to get up with stops and pictures, spent 30 minutes at the top but it was just so cold. Took us less than 30 min to get down. The elevation gain was challenging.\n- Two Jack Lake - Very pretty viewpoint! Go down the gravel path and look on either side for lovely views.\n- Lake Minnewanka - Eh, skip it.\n- Johnson Lake - Plenty of parking at 12:45 pm. Easy hike around the lake. Not worth it.\n\nSunday, 9/22\n- Took Fairview Limousine Shuttle to Moraine Lake.\n- Moraine Lake: Rockpile Trail (.8 km loop): Got to the lake at 7:45 and the shuttle left at 9 which was more than enough time. Quick walk up to take pics, hung out up there to pass the time until the bus came back.\n- Lake Louise: Lake Agnes Tea House Trail (3.4 km one way): Lake Louise was STUNNING. Completely uphill hike to tea house with stairs at the end. We stopped a lot of times and drank a lot of water. Took 1:15 on the way up. Lake Agnes was fine, but nothing compared to Lake Louise. Spent about an hour at the tea house, the wait really wasn\u2019t that long. Got tea, vegetable soup, biscuits, a cookie bar. Took an hour to get down. Much easier going down, but hard on the knees.\n\nMonday, 9/23\n- Hoodoos - Fine, pretty short. We followed the sign someone had written on and didn\u2019t go past where the trail ended because there were. no views past it. If you don\u2019t have time, this is fine to skip.\n- Bow River - We stopped at the Bow Falls Viewpoint for a picnic lunch. It was so peaceful. We didn\u2019t do the trails, but I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve been lovely. Even just stopping there for lunch was so nice. Highly recommend!\n\nBanff was incredible. Don\u2019t pass it up!",

Our tour guide spoke German but we were given an audio guide in English to listen to. The tour took about an hour, but I've knocked a star off my review because the guide seemed to mistime the tour and had to whizz us through the upstairs bedrooms etc, so much so that we couldn't listen to the audio guide info as he was moving from room to room so quickly.

We had booked our tickets online, so we could go straight to the entrance. During the check-in, our bags were scanned, but unfortunately, we were only told later, in the middle of one of the historical rooms, that we should have left our backpacks in the lockers. It would have been helpful to be informed about this when our bags were first checked. If so, it wouldn't have been an issue, and we would have left them immediately since we didn\u2019t need them.\n\nThe palace and monastery complex is a must for history enthusiasts! You can truly feel the history of Spain, whether under the Habsburgs or the Bourbons. The Royal Library and the Cathedral were especially impressive \u2013 real highlights.\n\nWhat stood out most to us, however, was the constant presence of Saint Lawrence. Everywhere in the complex, we could find his martyrdom attribute \u2013 particularly the grill on which he was executed. It was fascinating how deeply this symbolism was embedded in the architecture and artwork. In the galleries, on sculptures, and in various rooms, we encountered images of the saint in many forms, and each time, his suffering and devotion were palpable. This unique symbolic presence gave the entire place a profound spiritual meaning.\n\nAnother unforgettable experience was visiting the royal tombs of the Spanish kings. We visited the graves with reverence, trying to find well-known figures, such as Don Carlos (the son of King Philip II, known from Friedrich Schiller\u2019s work). Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t find him, and even after asking, no one was able to help us. In the Pantheon of the Kings, there were many visitors, and although photography wasn\u2019t allowed, the sight of the tombs was truly impressive. It was also interesting to note that the pantheon is completely filled \u2013 we wondered where later kings like Juan Carlos I and Felipe VI, with their queens, would be laid to rest.\n\nFinally, we visited the palace garden. A word of caution: the path through the garden is a one-way street, and you must walk back the same way to reach the exit. It can be a bit confusing for some visitors.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful trip, and we are grateful to have been able to experience Spain\u2019s history so closely. The deep symbolic presence of Saint Lawrence and the visit to the royal tombs made this journey an unforgettable experience.",

In my opinion, the content is quite limited and does not meet the level of expectation visitors would have for an attraction of this kind.\n\nFor comparison, a similar presentation I attended in Vienna offered a deeper understanding of the subject and a much richer experience for the audience.

The drive up to the park along the roads hugging cliff edges is a little scary if you're not fond of heights, but the park is totally worth the stressful drive.\n\nIt's like being transported into a different world when you're in Yosemite park. The scale of the trees and rocks and cliffs leave you feeling very small and the views are awe-inspiring! There are so many trails and the park is so vast, you'd definitely need at least several days to explore it all. I'd recommend planning out which trails and areas you'd like to explore ahead of time. There were restrooms available in rest areas or sometimes at the parking lots at the start of a trail - just note where they're at on the maps if you'd like to use a toilet before getting caught in the woods without one. Take a lot of water with you and stay hydrated, it was so hot out during the days we visited and depending on the area of the park you're in, we didn't see a lot of water refill areas. Definitely refill your bottles when you find a refill spot at a rest/lodging area.\n\nPaved areas where cars would drive and some viewpoints we saw were wheelchair accessible, but getting a parking spot near a viewpoint can be difficult/a bit of a wait depending on the time of day. A lot of dirt/grass trails in the woods we walked could be quite rocky and were not wheelchair accessible, so this would definitely be something to check ahead of time for specific areas you'd like to visit if accessibility is a concern.\n\nVisiting this park was an amazing experience and I'll definitely be going again!",

        "text": "Somapura Mahavihara, also known as Paharpur Boddho Bihar, is one of the most important archaeological and historical sites in Bangladesh. Located in the Naogaon district, this ancient Buddhist monastery was built in the late 8th or early 9th century during the Pala dynasty. It is one of the largest Buddhist viharas in the Indian subcontinent and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.\n\nThe site reflects the architectural grandeur of early Buddhist art and culture. The central structure is a massive quadrangular complex with a large stupa in the middle, which once served as the focal point for religious activities. Around it are numerous smaller stupas, shrines, and monastic cells that housed monks. The intricate terracotta plaques adorning the walls depict scenes from daily life, mythology, and religious stories.\n\nSomapura Mahavihara was not just a religious center but also a hub of learning, attracting scholars from different regions of Asia. Its influence spread across Southeast Asia, evidenced by similar architectural styles in countries like Myanmar and Indonesia. Despite its partial ruin today, Paharpur stands as a testament to Bangladesh's rich cultural and religious heritage, offering a glimpse into the flourishing Buddhist civilization of the past.",

Our adventure began with a cluster of jeeps, all patiently waiting for a glimpse of a tiger hidden in the bush. We waited nervously for about twenty minutes, and then we saw a quick but amazing sight: a tiger jumping on a deer. The deer, surprisingly alive, ran quickly across the road right in front of us. It was a moment of pure, wild nature. We kept going on our jeep ride, and it was really exciting! The Kohora area was full of life. There were lots of tall grasses, like elephant grass and sugarcane, and different trees like Kumbhi and cotton trees. We enjoyed every bit of it. We saw a big eagle sitting on a tree, looking around. Deer, blue bulls, and wild buffaloes were eating grass. We also saw a mother rhino with her babies, which was very special. Later, we saw two elephants standing in a field. Turtles and alligators were lying in the sun by the river.\nWe stopped for a break at a pretty lake. It was peaceful and quiet. Elevated view points offered panoramic vistas. Then we continued and saw some rare birds and pretty deer. Our three and a half hour ride around the Kohora area was great. When we got back to the gate, there were little shops selling souvenirs and snacks to remember our trip. It was a perfect ending to a wonderful day. We loved seeing all the amazing wildlife in Kaziranga. Bring water, binoculars, hats, and sunglasses.",

        "text": "Location and Values:\u00a0 The rock-art sites of Tadrart Acacus are found in a vast area of desert landscape around (and mostly to the north of) the town of Ghat in south-western Libya.\u00a0 The area includes the Acacus mountain range, and borders the Tassili N\u2019Ajjer world heritage site in neighbouring Algeria.\u00a0 Together with the Tassili N\u2019Ajjer it is the premier rock-art area in the world, with hundreds of engravings and thousands of paintings.\n\nThe rock art of Tadrart Acacus dates back as far as 12,000 years. This incredible open-air gallery tells the story of the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the people who have occupied the area over the millennia.\u00a0 It is a story that traces the environmental effects of climate change which can be divided into distinct periods according to the characteristics of the rock-art legacy.\u00a0 The oldest art belongs to the so-called\u00a0Wild Fauna Period\u00a0(10,000-6,000 BC) characterised by the portrayal of animals \u2013 elephants, giraffes, hippos and rhinos \u2013 that inhabited the area when it was much wetter than today.\u00a0 Overlapping with this era is the\u00a0Round Head Period\u00a0(8,000-6,000 BC) when human figures appear alongside painted circular heads devoid of features.\u00a0 At this time people were living as hunter-gatherers, but this gradually gave way to the\u00a0Pastoral Period\u00a0(5500-2000 BC) characterised by art that depicts the introduction of domesticated cattle, and a more settled existence with human figures handling spears and performing ceremonies.\u00a0 As the climate became progressively drier and long-distance travel more important, the art of the\u00a0Horse Period\u00a0(1000 BC \u2013 AD 1) shows the introduction of horses and horse-drawn chariots.\u00a0 Finally, the most recent period of rock-art in the Sahara (from about 200 BC to present) is the Camel Period, as these animals have played an increasingly important role.\n\nSlideshow of the Rock-Art Sites of Tadrart Acacus:\u00a0\u00a0The slideshow features a collection of stunning photos provided by David Coulson at the\u00a0Trust for African Rock Art, the premier organisation working for the conservation of this extraordinary heritage.\u00a0 It shows some of the incredible landscapes that provide a backdrop for this open-air gallery, and detailed studies of specific engravings and paintings from each of the main periods outlined above",

        "text": "When you are in southwestern Libya you feel the Saharan Tadrart Acacus mountains are windy, hot, and hyper-arid. But to your surprise the fossils recovered from the Saharan environment of the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya revealed that for much of the early and middle Holocene, from 10,200 to 4650 years back in time, this region was rich in water as well as life and was humid, with evidence of multiple human settlements and diverse fauna.\n\nTadrart Acacus has the rock shelters with significant floral and faunal remains, significant cultural artifacts and rock art pertaining to the period of early Holocene occupation of these shelters.\u00a0The rich population of fishes about 80 percent in the faunal remains during 10,200-8000 years before present time gradually reduced to 40 percent by 5900-4650 years BP.  Advancement of aridity in the region impacted the survival of tilapia.\nStanding now at  arid Tadrart Acacus and feeling the cool breeze of early and middle Holocene Period may be a tough task.\nEarth has its own calculations. After some years from now, who knows the Earth may decide to bring back the  greenary, the water, rich flora and fauna to Tadrart Acacus. Hope for the same. Visit the marvels of Nature here at Tadrart Acacus. Good luck.",

Caution: during the long often unnerving, winding route, you reach high altitudes and must take a day or two to adjust to elevation before attempting to cross the mountain. A museum with objects taken from the site is on the other side of town. The site dates from 1500BC, and has been used since long before, though signage explains most the main structures are 800s BC. They do not allow you to climb most stairs or explore a significant portion of the site, and some paths are controlled for continued excavations. You mostly see things from the other side of a fence. But in some moments you get to interact with the site and go down passageways etcetera. The environment is gorgeous, as you're surrounded 360\u00b0 by mountains.

Unfortunately, the hospital is still in restoration, so it is not open yet.  But the mosque itself is worth a visit.  The security guard was very nice and he tried to explain the history and key facts to us through google translate.\n\nMake sure you catch the shadow of the man reading the quran at the exit portal 3pm-4pm in summer time.  In the early morning, there is a woman shadow at the portal at the Mosque's entrance too.\n\nThe hotels in Divrigi may charge more for foreigners, so we camped at the ridge behind the Great Mosque for a night. For those who bought a tent with them, you may consider camping as an option.",

There are also many cafes and restaurants on-site, and a hotel as well. It can get quite crowded, so be prepared for that. The park opens at 9 am.

You can even see 14th century graffiti! Beautiful inside & out, nice views from the top.  You can actually be in with the bells at the top when they go off every quarter hour, so if loud noises bother you, take care not no be up there when they go off. We prepared ourselves and went up.

Occupied by many civilizations over time \u2013 including the Greeks, Byzantines, Ayyubids and Mamluks \u2013 the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought to originate from the Ayyubid period.

The climb was steep and demanding, but the anticipation of the view kept me going.\n\nAs I reached the peak, I was greeted with the most breathtaking view I have ever seen. The sun slowly rose over the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape. The sky was painted with vibrant hues of orange and pink, and the entire scene felt almost surreal. It was a moment of pure tranquility and awe.\n\nIn addition to the stunning sunrise, Taishan Mountain is rich in cultural and historical significance. The pathways are lined with ancient inscriptions and temples, each telling a story of the mountain's past. I took my time exploring these sites, immersing myself in the history and spirituality of the place.\n\nOverall, my visit to Taishan Mountain was an unforgettable experience. The combination of natural beauty, physical challenge, and cultural richness made it a truly unique adventure. I highly recommend anyone traveling to China to include Taishan Mountain in their itinerary. Witnessing the sunrise from the summit is a memory that will stay with you forever.",

        "text": "Mount Taishan is one of the five Sacred mountains in China. It is situated in Tai\u2019an city, Shandong Province. It is worth to mention that this mount is in the UNESCO world heritage sites. This is one of the most climbed mountains. The legend says that all Kings of China have had climbed this mountain and prayed for the success to the God. The best time for climbing us Summer and spring. If you want to have a nice scenery, then avoid to climb the mount in winter and Autumn. During my first climbing I could see the mountain and the city all in fog which doesn\u2019t happen often as the locals say and only the luckiest people can be witnesses of this beauty. Another best time to visit the mountain is any night in summer because in the morning you will find an amazing sunset view if the weather is nice and not rainy. You can climb by foot which will take about 4 hours if you take a bus to the starting point. You might also take a cable car to the top which is not operating at night. In case of climbing at night be ready to experience cold on the top. Prepare tent where you can sleep and have  jackets with you.",

The majesty of this ancient wonder is simply amazing and exceeded all my expectations.\nFrom a logistical point of view, the visit was well organized. The transportation system to reach the wall is efficient, with buses and shuttle services departing regularly from major nearby cities, such as Beijing. The ticket offices are also well signposted and the staff is always available to help.\nThe wall itself is an extraordinary work of engineering. The restored sections are well preserved, allowing you to walk along the ancient stones without problems. The views that open before your eyes, as you go up, are breathtaking: you can admire the wall that winds winding between the hills and mountains, getting lost on the horizon. It\u2019s an experience that makes you really appreciate the grandeur of this monument.\nA particularly fascinating aspect of the visit is the rich history that surrounds every stone of the wall. Along the way, there are several watchtowers and stations, each of which tells a story of the Chinese imperial past. The local guides offer interesting historical explanations that further enrich the experience.\nUseful Tips\nClothing: I recommend wearing comfortable shoes and clothing suitable for the weather, as the route can be quite demanding.\nTry to arrive early to avoid the crowds and enjoy the tranquility of the early morning hours.\nVisiting the Great Wall of China is a unique and unforgettable experience. The combination of breathtaking landscapes, fascinating history and extraordinary engineering makes this visit absolutely unmissable for anyone in China. The wall is not only an architectural work, but a true symbol of the resilience and greatness of Chinese civilization.",

The Imperial Palace of the Qing Dynasty in Shenyang consists of 114 buildings constructed between 1625\u201326 and 1783.

Only without the crowds will the full beauty reveal itself.\n\nPS: I could not add this onto the map, but I wanted people to go and try it nonetheless: Xi'an is well - known for its colorful cuisine. One of these famous dishes is a \"Persimmon pancake\" or \u67ff\u5b50\u997c. Normally these pancakes would be made only of fried dough, but as luck would have it we found a small shop in a narrow alley away from the crowds, where honey filling was inserted into the fried pancake - result: an absolutely delicious sweet snack taken directly out of my dreams. I warmly suggest everyone to install Amap (a Chinese map app but in English - it will help you to navigate when in China in general) and insert the address below.

This site lies about 42 km south-west of Beijing and is at the juncture of the North China Plain and the Yanshan Mountains. Adequate water supplies and natural limestone caves in this area provided an optimal survival environment for early humans. Scientific work at the site is still under way. So far, ancient human fossils, cultural remains and animal fossils from 23 localities within the property dating from 5 million years ago to 10,000 years ago have been discovered by scientists. These include the remains of Homo erectus pekinensis, who lived in the Middle Pleistocene (700,000 to 200,000 years ago), archaic Homo sapiens of about 200,000\u2013100,000 years ago and Homo sapiens sapiens dating back to 30,000 years ago. At the same time, fossils of hundreds of animal species, over 100,000 pieces of stone tools and evidence (including hearths, ash deposits and burnt bones) of Peking Man using fire have been discovered.\n\nAs the site of significant hominid remains discovered in the Asian continent demonstrating an evolutionary cultural sequence, Zhoukoudian is of major importance within the worldwide context. It is not only an exceptional reminder of the prehistoric human societies of the Asian continent, but also illustrates the process of human evolution, and is of significant value in the research and reconstruction of early human history.",

In the age that followed, as thought and art flourished, an exceptional group of artists put into effect the ambitious plans of Athenian statesman Pericles and, under the inspired guidance of the sculptor Pheidias, transformed the rocky hill into a unique monument of thought and the arts. The most important monuments were built during that time: the Parthenon, built by Ictinus, the Erechtheon, the Propylaea, the monumental entrance to the Acropolis, designed by Mnesicles and the small temple Athena Nike.&nbsp;</p>",

The ferry ride takes around 60-75 minutes to reach the island. Once you arrive, you\u2019ll find small stores selling snacks. You can also purchase a toy train ticket for \u20b935 per person.\n\nHowever, I would recommend skipping the toy train. There\u2019s no one to check the tickets, and the crowd often behaves chaotically to board it. Instead, you can walk to the entry point, which is more convenient.\n\nThe entry fee from the main gate is \u20b910 per person. From there, it\u2019s a 20-minute walk to the Elephanta Caves. Be prepared to climb around 150-200 stairs to reach the caves. Along the way, you\u2019ll find many small shops selling items and food. (Please note, be cautious of monkeys, as they may snatch things from your hands).\n\nOnce you reach the top and enter the caves, there\u2019s an additional entry fee of \u20b950 per person. Inside, you can explore the caves, admire the architecture, and learn about the sculptures and their historical significance.\n\nThis place is deeply rooted in history, and while the journey there is the highlight, I especially enjoyed the ferry ride, the sunset, and the overall adventure. It\u2019s a one-time visit kind of place, but definitely worth experiencing.",

Its 53-m <em>vimana</em> (sanctum tower) has recessed corners and a graceful upward curving movement, contrasting with the straight and severe tower at Thanjavur. The Airavatesvara temple complex, built by Rajaraja II, at Darasuram features a 24-m <em>vimana</em> and a stone image of Shiva. The temples testify to the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze casting.</p>",

While walking our guide told us in detail how agriculture and mother earth is all connected, how the way of living were decided through the Mayan calender and the connected events.\n\nSuddenly as we entered a clearing in the morning mist we had a glimpse of the ruins. The scene was as taken from an Indiana Jones movie and made a lasting impression, just beutiful\n\nWe walked around and into some of the temples while our guide told us everything worth knowing. We even took an extra trip into the jungle where there are wildlife and ruins that have not yet been dug out.\n\nWe can highly recommend hiring a guide as you will get so much more out of your visit with help from an experienced person.\n\nI very highly recommend a visit to these ruins. There is so much to learn from these original original inhabitants and their way of living.\n\nI gave come to love this place \ud83e\udd70",

The remains of the Limes today consist of vestiges of built walls, ditches, forts, fortresses, watchtowers and civilian settlements. Certain elements of the line have been excavated, some reconstructed and a few destroyed. The two sections of the Limes in Germany cover a length of 550 km from the north-west of the country to the Danube in the south-east. The 118-km-long Hadrian\u2019s Wall (UK) was built on the orders of the Emperor Hadrian c. AD 122 at the northernmost limits of the Roman province of Britannia. It is a striking example of the organization of a military zone and illustrates the defensive techniques and geopolitical strategies of ancient Rome. The Antonine Wall, a 60-km long fortification in Scotland was started by Emperor Antonius Pius in 142 AD as a defense against the \u201cbarbarians\u201d of the north.

This visit was nothing short of magical, transporting me back to an era where sport and medicine were intertwined in the most profound ways.\n\nLocated next to the famed Sanctuary of Asklepios, this stadium is a testament to the architectural prowess and cultural sophistication of ancient Greece. The moment you step onto the sacred ground, you're enveloped by a sense of awe. The remnants of the starting lines, the semi-circular seating for spectators, and the panoramic views of the surrounding Peloponnese countryside create an unforgettable ambiance.\n\nWhat struck me most was the harmonious blend of nature with man-made structures; olive trees and wildflowers now grow where once athletes competed, adding a layer of peace to this energetic venue of the past. The acoustics, even in ruins, hint at the vibrant gatherings that once filled these spaces with cheers and the sounds of competition.\n\nThe experience of walking down the ancient path toward the starting blocks, imagining the athletes preparing for their races, gives you a real sense of connection to those who came before us. This site is not just about sport; it's a celebration of human achievement, health, and the pursuit of excellence.\n\nFor anyone with a passion for history, archaeology, or simply those in search of a profound travel experience, this stadium in Epidaurus is a must-see. It\u2019s not just a place; it's a story, an echo of our collective past, and a reminder of the enduring legacy of Greek culture.

It felt rejuvenating, surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature.\n\nGuided Experience:\nI highly recommend hiring a registered forest tour guide. Their knowledge added immense value to my experience, as they pointed out various species of plants and animals that I would have otherwise overlooked. Their passion for the forest was infectious.\n\nPreparation Tips:\nA must-do is to wear leach socks! It made my exploration much more comfortable, as leeches can be quite prevalent in wet areas.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you\u2019re a nature enthusiast or just looking for a peaceful retreat away from the hustle and bustle, Sinharaja Forest should definitely be on your travel list.

        "text": "Visiting the Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi was a profoundly enriching experience during my solo trip. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Sanchi is a treasure trove of history, culture, and spirituality. The site\u2019s ancient stupas, monasteries, and intricate carvings reflect the essence of Buddhist art and architecture, making it a must-visit for history buffs, spiritual seekers, and travelers alike.\n\nThe Good:\nArchitectural Grandeur: The Great Stupa (Stupa No. 1), the most prominent structure at Sanchi, is a marvel of ancient Indian architecture. Its massive dome, surrounded by exquisitely carved gateways (toranas), tells stories from Buddha's life and Jataka tales. The craftsmanship is truly awe-inspiring.\nRich History: Sanchi\u2019s monuments date back to the 3rd century BCE, commissioned by Emperor Ashoka, and stand as a testament to the spread of Buddhism in India. Walking through the site feels like stepping back in time and connecting with a rich cultural heritage.\nPeaceful Ambience: The site exudes a serene and tranquil atmosphere, ideal for introspection and meditation. Surrounded by lush greenery, Sanchi offers a perfect escape from the chaos of city life.\nWell-Maintained: The Archaeological Survey of India has done an excellent job maintaining the site. The pathways are clean, and there are information boards that provide context to the monuments, making the visit informative and engaging.\nPanoramic Views: Located on a hilltop, Sanchi offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The panoramic vistas add to the spiritual and aesthetic charm of the site.\nMuseum: The on-site museum houses several artifacts and relics from Sanchi and nearby regions. It\u2019s a great place to delve deeper into the history and significance of the site.\nThe Challenges:\nHot Weather: If you visit during the summer months, the heat can be intense. There is limited shade, so carrying water and a hat is essential.\nConnectivity: Sanchi is a bit off the beaten path, and reaching the site can be challenging if you don\u2019t have your own vehicle. Public transport options are limited, so plan accordingly.\nLimited Food Options Nearby: While there are small eateries around, the food choices are basic. If you have specific dietary preferences, it\u2019s better to carry your own snacks.\nCrowds on Weekends: Sanchi can get crowded on weekends and holidays, which might take away from the peaceful experience. Solo travelers seeking solitude may prefer to visit on weekdays.\nSuggestions for Future Visitors:\nBest Time to Visit: Plan your trip during the cooler months (October to March) for a more comfortable experience.\nStart Early: Arrive early in the morning to avoid crowds and enjoy the site in peace. The early hours also provide better lighting for photography.\nCarry Essentials: Bring water, sunscreen, a hat, and comfortable walking shoes, as you\u2019ll be exploring the site extensively.\nHire a Guide: To fully appreciate the historical and cultural significance of the monuments, consider hiring a local guide. Their insights and storytelling will make your visit more meaningful.\nCombine with Nearby Attractions: If time permits, explore nearby sites like Udayagiri Caves, which are also rich in history and heritage.\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi are a true gem of India\u2019s cultural and spiritual heritage. The site beautifully blends history, art, and serenity, making it a must-visit for anyone traveling through Madhya Pradesh. My solo visit was a journey of discovery and reflection, offering a deeper understanding of India\u2019s rich Buddhist legacy.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a history enthusiast, a spiritual seeker, or a curious traveler, Sanchi has something to offer. The mesmerizing architecture, tranquil surroundings, and profound historical significance make it an unforgettable destination.",

The cliff, which in geological terms corresponds to a sheer rock face, composed of sedimentary rock, is, in the case of Bandiagara, a wall approximately 500 meters high, which emerges from sandy soil, almost 200 kilometers long. Located in eastern Mali not very far (about 65 kilometers) from the city of Mopti. Its importance is increased by the presence of human settlements dating back to the 11th century. In fact, at that time the Tellems arrived on the cliff, a pygmy people (at least this is the opinion that archaeologists gave after finding bone texts in the tombs), who lived in accommodation created between caves and hollows in the rock. They chose that place due to its difficult accessibility, in fact they accessed their homes through ropes, thus making their lives safer.\nStarting from the 14th century, another people arrived in the area, the Dogon, fleeing from the Islamic invasions in the Mend\u00e8 kingdom and in an attempt to preserve their culture and their complex traditions. They settled in the area of \u200b\u200bthe cliff (today, in fact, the cliff is called \"land of the Dogon\"), leading to the escape of the Tellem (towards Burkina Faso) or their assimilation. In fact, archaeologists have found many elements among the Dogon customs that recall the Tellem traditions. The Dogon, a very interesting people from an ethnographic point of view and with a complex cosmogony, have transformed over time the caves inhabited by the Tellem into burial places, causing the around them an aura of mystery and sacredness.\n\nIn 1989, UNESCO included the Bandiagara Cliff among the World Heritage Sites to be protected and preserved for posterity. There is great fear for the stability of buildings which require continuous and constant maintenance.\n\nThe Cliff constitutes a complex cultural place, made up of almost 300 Dogon villages, ancient quarries and tomb architecture, and masked rites which still today (despite the abandonment of the villages witnessed in recent decades) make this place unique and rare.",

Near the edge of the reserve is a more forested area with many species of lemurs and birds-perfect for the enthusiast. But I would recommend against bringing an expensive camera as it is most certainly going to get damaged.

Great hike on beatiful trails to the hundreds of well preserved cave paintings.   We did a 1.5-day tour to cover different areas of the park.   A guide is required.   Most guides don't speak English.    So if you are not fluent in Portugese or Spanish, I recommend that you ask the hotel to help recommending an English-speaking guide for you in advance. Baixo Ouro Park Hotel is the best place to stay.   It's a beautiful hotel with basic but very clean rooms, and located only a few-minute drive from the main entrance.

The exterior is very impressive with its gothic architecture and gargoyles.\n\nThe Reims cathedral is the traditional place where the kings of France were once coronated.

Also it is surprisingly a great place for relaxation!\n\nThe entry is free to the premises of the Abbey, however if visitors want to visit the chambers of the Kings Hall, a guided tour ticket must be purchased. Unfortunately the tours are available only in German (if you want English, you need to contract the place in advance). Luckily the staff here was very friendly and welcoming, therefore they let me join the German tour to visit the chambers only, free of charge! Very much appreciated!\n\nThe whole area of the Abbey is very well preserved and maintained, it is neat and clean, especially the pitch-perfect grass is very inviting. In the nearby museum, where guided tour tickets can be purchased (payments possible with card), some English brochures with explanations about this place are available. Many restaurants and cafes are lined up on the road leading to the main square, therefore plenty of choice of food. Train station is approximately 10 minutes away by foot.\n\nRecommended If you pass by, however I would not plan this as a main destination. Visited in August 2022.",

FYI buy your Borobudur tickets online a week in advance- this is a new process implemented two months ago! With the ticket purchased from Borobudur as \u2018foreigners\u2019 we enter through a different entrance where it is air conditioned, with fresh clean toilets and we get a free bottle of water. There is also the option to hire a professional guide (110k). Personally, I found this temple more enjoyable than Borobudur. We had free range to explore the grounds without the limitations instilled at Borobudur at a flat rate price. There are actually four temple spots to visit. I highly recommend checking out the smaller ones first as they aren\u2019t far from the main one and are hardly visited but are just as fascinating and beautiful- they are also older than the main site. There are options to cycle or take a large golf cart there but it\u2019s unnecessary as they aren\u2019t that far. However, the walk to the exit is a very long way and ends with a long journey through souvenir shops, drink stands, etc. with crowds of visitors heading the same way. Prambanan temple is totally worth visiting, friendlier staff and better managed compared to Borobudur :) All up we spent about two hours here.

The city was founded by King Ramathibodi I in 1351, though it is thought to be significantly older based on evidence that the area was already occupied during the Mon Dvaravati period. Further sources mention that the area was occupied by the Khmers around 850AD and they established a stronghold naming it Ayodhta after one of the holiest Hindu cities in India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 at that time. The early history of Ayutthaya is connected to this Khmer settlement.\nThe city was captured by the Burmese \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf2 in 1569. Though not pillaged, the city lost many valuable and artistic artifacts. It was the capital of the country until its destruction by the Burmese army in 1767. In 1969, the Thai Government began renovations of the ruins, scaling up the project after the site was declared a historical park in 1976. Part of the park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.\nEverything about the site is on a grand scale. It\u2019s huge so be prepared for a lot of walking and wear comfortable shoes. Take your time going through the site, and maybe come by yourself without a guide so you can take all the time you need. Wear long pants and cover your shoulders because they might not let you in if you are not dressed modestly. But wear comfortable clothes as the site is spread out over several kilometres. The entrance fee is 50 Baht, this will get you to all areas. Take water and a hat. Might be best to visit early in morning or afternoon to avoid heat. You can rent a bike as a way of getting around the park. There are several sales stalls selling souvenirs and something to eat. Ayutthaya is a place reeking of history and spirituality. It showcases Thailands rich heritage. It\u2019s a MUST when visiting Thailand. Thumbs Up!!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

It helps paint a picture about the birth and development of Bangkok. It is very educational but also relaxing and eye opening to see. So many opportunities for nice photos, practice your photography skills at the same time feel you took a Time Machine back in history. Go early to avoid the crowds. Spend the night in Ayutthaya for a more relaxed experience and to see more of the historical sites. I also think it is great to stay to support the local restaurants and guesthouses. Anyways it is a nice change of pace from the big city. You can take tour guide one day and explore at your own pace the next day.\n\nTo be honest, even after two full days here I would still return just for the visuals of sunsets over the temples and to be around the friendly people of Ayutthaya.",

        "text": "UNESCO world heritage site that needs not much introduction. There is a new bullet train station called Huanglongjiuzhai, which would bring you much closer to this park. It would still take about 1.5 hours to 2 hours to get here, so definitely recommended to stay at a location near to this place and then dedicate a full day for this. First of all, the park is huge and most likely you would not be able to see all of the lakes. But there are a couple of must go spots which are the most spectacular or beautiful. Due to the number of tourists daily, the park has defined processes so it is rather easy to navigate the park. For example, upon entering the park, the bus that we boarded brought us to long lake, which is at the 1 end of the park. If we would have board another bus, we may have ended at the other end of the park. Generally, the idea is to start from one end of the park and travel towards the mid point when the 2 valleys intersect, then head to the other end and go from there. It is almost impossible to walk the entire park, but there would be prominent points where you are encouraged the board the bus to narrow the walking distance to the next lake/spot. The restaurant/food are only at Nuorilang centre, while there are other snacks at the various spots around the park. Note the pass is only for a single day visit so if you plan to do 2 days to explore the park, you will need to buy entrance ticket for each day. There are also plenty of toilets within the park.",

I really appreciate him going out of the way to add fun to the tour. It was an amazing and adventurous experience, and I highly recommend his tour. The reception staff were also very friendly and helpful (she helped us choose the appropriate tour), as was the lovely lady at the shop. Overall, it was a fantastic visit!

After all this, you return to peace to others.\u00a0 With all this on the Solovki Islands, fifty kilometers from the Arctic Circle! - well developed modern service, tourist and tourist infrastructure.\u00a0 It is important that in this place they are not intrusive. Almost all the churches of the Solovetsky monastery are active, with the exception of the Transfiguration Cathedral, where the service takes place on special occasions, such as each of visas!\u00a0 the patriarch. This church can take part in the liturgy, put candles and submit notes. Those interested can purchase icons of the holy founders of the monastery of Zosima and Savvati. By the way, in front of the huge altar of the Transfiguration Cathedral in the floor of the temple there are several ancient bricks from the imprint of the house of the 15th-century master monks.\u00a0 Putting your palm to them, you can make a handshake through the centuries. Trinity Cathedral is distinguished by a huge refectory, designed for 200 people. It is interesting that the monastery lives .. lisa! She can be seen during a tour of the inner space of the monastery. Attention travelers! On the Solovki Islands, there are only two mobile operators: Megafon and MTS.\n\nThose who wish to swim in the White Sea should be borne in mind that at the end of June, at least during my visit, the water temperature was about seven degrees.\u00a0 A small beach suitable for swimming is called by the locals (there are about nine hundred people on the Solovki island, by the way) Malibu. The beach is located about four kilometers from the village, a little further than Negotiation Stone, near which negotiations took place in the 19th century between the abbot of the monastery and the commander of the English squadron during the siege of the island during the Crimean War.",

On the other hand, it's easier to use crampons when it's snowing.\nWell, I don't think there are many people who go there, but I don't really recommend going from spring to autumn because it's not a pleasant ridgeline walk as you just have to look up and walk through the trees. But winter is a route.\nHowever, if you take the wrong stream on your way back, you may get lost or dangerous.\n\nThe general Mt. Yasuyama route continues in a zigzag pattern, with the best views at the top of the ridge. Fun for all seasons. There is a mountain hut where you can rest and a space where you can rest.\nThe wind from the Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan side is often strong, but when it's calm, you can enjoy a relaxing meal and coffee using the fire upstairs. The best.\n\nOnce again, when there is still snow or when there is gas, you may get lost even when you think you have climbed many times and are familiar with the mountain.\nSometimes I decide that if I get off here, I'll go along the stream and end up in a different place. So, a map and compass are still important!\nSpeaking from experience, I once failed while absentmindedly following a trace.\nIf you're not careful, you'll be in trouble.\n\nBut I still like the mountain because it feels good.\nYou can see Mt.

The ruins we explored are remnants of this ambitious project aimed at evangelizing the indigenous Guaran\u00ed people.\n\nThe most impressive site we visited was Trinidad, just outside Encarnaci\u00f3n. As we walked among the red sandstone remains, we were struck by the grand scale and sophisticated architecture. The main plaza, surrounded by the church, workshops, and living quarters, gives a sense of what a bustling community this once was. Intricate stone carvings and fragments of colorful frescoes hint at the artistic achievements of the Guaran\u00ed craftsmen under Jesuit guidance. It's mind-boggling to think these structures were built in the middle of the subtropical forest over 300 years ago.\n\nNearby, the ruins of Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue offered another perspective.

Think about it: when this church was first built, there were no cars, no cell phones, not even the Philippines as we know it today! And yet, here it is, holding centuries of stories within its walls.\n\nDuring World War II, much of Intramuros was destroyed, but San Agustin Church miraculously survived. It became a refuge for locals and a silent witness to the chaos outside. If these walls could talk, they\u2019d tell tales of hope, loss, and resilience.\n\nStepping Inside Is Like Entering Another Era\n\nThe moment you walk in, you\u2019re hit with the beauty of its intricate ceiling paintings\u2014but here\u2019s the kicker: they\u2019re actually optical illusions! The ceilings aren\u2019t carved, but painted in a way that tricks your eyes into seeing depth and texture. How cool is that?\n\nThen, there\u2019s the grand chandeliers, antique wooden pews, and centuries-old tombs (yes, some important historical figures are buried here). Every corner of this church whispers stories of faith, love, and even heartbreak.\n\nMore Than Just a Church\n\nSan Agustin Church isn\u2019t just a place of worship\u2014it\u2019s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a museum, and one of the most popular wedding venues in the country. Imagine getting married in a place where history and romance collide!\n\nWhy You Need to See It for Yourself\n\nSome places look good in pictures, but this one? You have to feel it. Stand under its towering arches, run your fingers along its centuries-old stone walls, and listen to the echoes of history. It\u2019s not just a church\u2014it\u2019s a time machine, a reminder of our past, and a symbol of resilience.",

As one of the largest castle grounds I\u2019ve ever seen, it truly leaves a lasting impression. The sheer scale and beauty of the castle, perched high on a hill, is breathtaking. The panoramic views of the surrounding countryside alone make it worth the visit.\n\nThe castle itself is rich in history, with many sections to explore, from ancient ruins to restored areas, each giving a glimpse into medieval life. We found it fascinating to walk through the grounds and imagine what life was like during its peak. If you're a fan of castles, Spi\u0161 Castle will not disappoint\u2014its size, beauty, and history combine to make it a must-see destination.\n\nWhether you're exploring the castle ruins or enjoying the scenic views, Spi\u0161 Castle is an unforgettable stop for history buffs and casual tourists alike.

It would have been nice to have an audio tape, I think it would be a nice touch to offer that (for a price).\nIt was very, very hot (for us) outside but there are lots of benches and places to sit down. Also there are a lot of places to purchase water or drinks. I only saw one WC, but there must be more.\n\nThe grounds are huge and beautiful but be prepared for some walking. I feel like we only saw part of it and we walked six miles \ud83d\ude01\n\nIf you are considering going, I strongly recommend it. You will see many Vietnamese young ladies getting their pictures done for instagram.

        "text": "We booked a private English Speaking driver through TripAdvisor.  It worked beautiful and our driver was great.  Chengde is a small city by Chinese standards about 3.5 million people. Chengde is in the Hebei province about 250 KM northeast of Beijing and was established during the Qing-dynasty as an imperial summer residence. The city\u2019s core remains the 18th-century Mountain Resort palace complex. To give you a perspective.  We visited on a Friday\u2026leaving Beijing at 5 a.m. and arrived in less than 2.5 hours.  However, our drive back to the city on Friday afternoon took us over 5 hours.  It was long, tiring and filled with accidents. We also traveled during the National Holiday in October so there were more people out and about than normal.\n\nThe Summer Mountain Resort was built on a lake and had at least 36 different points of interested.  At each point there was a different description such as: 1) This is where one would be entertained by music 2) this is where one would relax in the morning sun and warm oneself or 3) this is a place where one would be entertained by jesters.  It was kind of funny to me that they took the time to point this out.  They had buildings at  all these sights, many of which were closed.\n\nAs we walked the property, My husband stated the obvious, you know why the emperor chose this location.  It was simply gorgeous and relaxing, even with the holiday crowds. Everywhere you looked there was something new to look at and something interesting to see.  The space was beautiful and we are from the State of Washington in the US.\n\nYou entered the main campus through what felt like a village and a museum like area with artifacts.  We did not spend a lot of time here because it was incredibly crowded.  Then you walked down a hill and the beauty opened up to you.  We headed to the island in the middle of the lake first and worked our way over to the palace.\n\nWe chose to stay to the right and walk along the stone pathway. The path we took was long and along the waters edge.  The inlet was built in the early 1700's.  Their was a boat out in the water that day that had a lady dancing to someone playing the harp on it.  The music filled the valley.  It was so peaceful and relaxing as we walked along the waters edge.\n\nThe temple is a long way over, so plan for walking shoes, but the walk is beautiful.  We enjoyed the walk as a family and had fun along the way.  As we approached the palace, we chose to climb up to it along a rock path in the back and among the trees.  You can take a boat over the the palace if you chose and the boat drop off point was in the front.  The main entrance was packed on the holiday week and you could hardly move, so our access point made getting to the top fairly easy.  As we approached the top and looked back, we noted a garden on the other side of the hill.  We had to go take a look at that as well.\n\nOver all it was a busy 3 hours for us.  You could spend all day at the property, enjoy a picnic along the lake.  Because we had the driver for only one day, we moved on to our next adventure.",

However the surviving buildings exemplify the architectural and artistic achievements of China\u2019s secular and religious buildings of the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. The Ancient Building Complex reached its apogee during the Ming dynasty, with 9 palaces, 9 monasteries, 36 nunneries and 72 temples, following the major building campaign undertaken by Emperor Zhu Di to align his imperial regime with Taoism. Today, 53 ancient buildings and 9 architectural sites survive, including the Golden Shrine and the Ancient Bronze Shrine, which are prefabricated buildings in bronze made in 1307; the stone-walled Forbidden City of 1419; Purple Heaven Palace built originally in the 12th century, rebuilt in the 15th century and extended in the 19th century; the Nanyang Palace of the 12th and 13thcenturies; the Fuzhen Temple of the 15th and 17th centuries and the stone Zhishi-Xuanyue Gateway built to mark the entrance to the Wudang Mountains in 1522.\n\nThe buildings in the Wudang Mountains exhibit exceptional architectural art and technology and represent the highest level of Chinese art and architecture achieved over a period of nearly 1,000 years. They are examples of religious and secular buildings closely associated with the growth of Taoism in China and lavishly endowed by successive Emperors. As an exceptionally large and well-preserved Taoist building complex it is important material evidence for studying early Ming politics and the Chinese history of religion.",

        "text": "One of the best works of the brilliant Czech architect with Italian ancestors, Jan Bla\u017eej Santini-Aichel, is one of the most original examples of the so-called Baroque Gothic, that you can see only in Czech. In an incredibly elaborate building a number of symbols and religious and historical messages is hidden. The symbols are dominated by the tongue, the five-pointed star and the number five. The foundation of the church was connected with the forthcoming beatification and canonization of John of Nepomuk. Construction began in 1719, in 1922 the church was consecrated.\n\nTip: if you are not a fan of mass tourism, I recommend special winter visits. In sunny weather, the church and the surrounding countryside have their charms, plus instead of buses full of tourists, there were around twelve of us here. Not only was it time to see everything thoroughly, but even the guide's interpretation did not have to be like machine gun and there was time for conversation as well.\n\n\u00da\u017easn\u00e9 d\u00edlo geni\u00e1ln\u00edho \u010desk\u00e9ho architekta s italsk\u00fdmi p\u0159edky, Jana Bla\u017eeje Santiniho-Aichela, p\u0159edstavuje jednu z nejorigin\u00e1ln\u011bj\u0161\u00edch p\u0159\u00edklad\u016f tzv. barokn\u00ed gotiky.

Despite reconstruction, after passing through the main gate, one chapel inside of the outer walls was open and available for visitors, especially those that want to pray - there was a maintained altar.\nThe hill itself and the space outside of the complex offer a nice view at the town and the places around.\nBe mindful when you plan to arrive by car, though. The parking place at the top of the hill is for 4 cars and that parking place is full of locals getting there by car just to go for a walk with their kids. There are additional parking places under he hill, but then you need to walk a bit on the road for cars. This place was not in Waze at the time when I visited the church.\nSince this is a church, there is no public toilet for the visitors, so count with that.\nI recommend to check when the place is open, and plan the trip after the reconstruction is done.

The other two are already inscribed on the World Heritage List. The Tlaxcala ensemble of buildings provides an example of the architectural model and spatial solutions developed in response to a new cultural context, which integrated local elements to create spaces such as wide atria, and\u00a0capilla posa\u00a0chapels. The edifice presents two other particular features, a free-standing tower and a wooden mud\u00e9jar not found in the other monasteries already inscribed on the World Heritage List as part of the serial property. It contributes to a better understanding of the development of a new architectural model that influenced both urban development and monastic buildings until the 18th\u00a0century.</p>",

On the outskirts of the city there is a specialised airport, a flying base. Several companies offer their services here. Tickets should be purchased in advance. The small aircraft, seating 4-5-6 people, will take visitors on a predetermined route, during which they will be able to see a number of figures from above. For safety reasons, there are two pilots on board. By default, one of them will inform the passengers, via a headset, during the flight, where to find the next diagram when looking down from above. The small aircraft is tilted to the right and left near the figure, so that passengers on both sides can see and photograph what they see. The altitude, the general behaviour of the small plane in the air, the right to left tilt and the considerable distance between camera and images, to a greater or lesser extent, brought out a little \"sea\" sickness in everyone during the flight. Once on the ground, they are treated using simple methods, but a doctor is also available. The experience made up for the difficulties. The staff are helpful, friendly and helpful. Even though it is \"only\" a domestic flight, expect a security check and take your passport with you! At the airport, you will also be able to buy food, toilets and souvenirs.

Although we don't regret our visit to see the gorillas, the experience is a bit romanticized and we did not completely feel it was worth the cost. Your group size is unknown until you arrive but I think there is a cap of 8 which does not include the multiple guides, porters, trackers, and armed guards that accompany you. This doesn't seem like a lot of people until you begin trekking through the jungle and divert from the main road. The park officials advertise the experience as though you'll be tracking the gorillas yourself when in reality, the park staff closely monitor each of the habituated groups and pretty much know where they are from morning until night. That is the job of the gorilla trackers, to go out early in the morning before your trek starts so your guide can lead you right to them. This is of course to guarantee tourist satisfaction and sighting of the gorillas. The distance you have to trek varies based on the gorilla family you are assigned. Our particular guide was not very engaging and had to be prompted to provide more information about the gorillas and their behaviors, family history, etc. They state an observation distance of 7m from the gorillas at all times but I can confidently tell you our group was often closer than that and actively encouraged by park staff to stand closer to get a better photo. As a result of standing so close there were two instances when the gorillas moved very quickly past us, not leaving much time to safely move out of their way. The entire experience felt more like being in a zoo with no fence. I appreciate the conservation work and efforts to employ the local people but I had wished the experience would have felt a bit more authentic rather than like a Disneyland ride. Was it cool to see the gorillas, see them in their natural habitat, and take a few photos? Of course! Would I do it again? Likely not. I might rather stay at the Engagi Lodge or take a tour around the Buhoma Village in hopes of a gorilla sighting instead.",

        "text": "A Heavenly Hike Through Canaima National Park\n\nIf you're looking for a destination that combines breathtaking natural beauty with a healthy dose of adventure, Canaima National Park in Venezuela is the place to be. With its surreal landscapes, including the world's tallest waterfall and the mysterious tepuis (table-top mountains), this park is a must-visit for anyone with a sense of wanderlust and a love for the great outdoors.\nThe star attraction is undoubtedly Angel Falls, which plunges a staggering 979 meters from the top of Auyantepuy, one of the many tepuis that dot the park. A trek to the base of the falls is a highlight of any visit, and while it's not an easy journey (with a 30-minute hike over large tree roots), the reward is well worth the effort. The sight of the falls, especially during the wet season when the rivers are full, is nothing short of awe-inspiring.\nAside from the falls, the park offers a variety of other sights and activities. The landscape is a fascinating mix of grasslands, dense jungle, and the unique tepuis, which harbor some of the most unusual life on earth. A visit to Canaima National Park is like stepping back in time, into a prehistoric world that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World.\"\nOne of the best ways to experience the park is on a three-day, two-night trip from Canaima camp. The tour includes the flight to Canaima, meals, and accommodation at various campsites along the river towards the falls. This gives you a chance to fully immerse yourself in the park's natural beauty and to learn about the indigenous Pemon people, who have been the stewards of this land for centuries.\nHowever, a visit to Canaima National Park isn't without its challenges. The park is remote and access is mostly by boat or plane. The dry season can make the journey to Angel Falls more difficult, and at the end of this season, the river levels can be too low for boats to make the trip. Accommodation options in the park are limited and can be expensive, so be prepared to rough it a bit.\nDespite these challenges, a trip to Canaima National Park is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The combination of stunning natural beauty, unique geological formations, and the opportunity to learn about the Pemon culture make it a truly unforgettable destination. So pack your hiking boots, a sense of adventure, and get ready for a journey into a world unlike any other.",

One fun fact is that the cathedral was originally planned to be even larger, but funding issues\u2014due to the decline of Kutn\u00e1 Hora\u2019s silver mines\u2014halted its expansion.

The highlight of our visit was seeing the famous Allegory of Good and Bad Government, an incredible fresco by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Located in the Sala dei Nove, this masterpiece gives a powerful visual representation of how good governance can lead to prosperity and peace, while bad governance brings corruption and decay. The details in the fresco are stunning, and it\u2019s amazing to think about how it\u2019s stood the test of time since it was painted in the 14th century.\n\nAside from the fresco, the building itself is rich in history and offers a deep dive into Siena\u2019s medieval past. The architecture and other artwork throughout the Palazzo are equally impressive. We spent about an hour exploring, but the Allegory was definitely the star of the show.\n\nThe gift shop at the Palazzo Pubblico was a pleasant surprise, offering a variety of beautiful souvenirs and art-inspired gifts. It\u2019s a great place to pick up something special to remember your visit. If you\u2019re in Siena, this is a must-see spot that combines art, history, and culture in one amazing experience!",

Mountain sides and hills carved out by hand to build terraced fields combined with a rainforest fed irrigation system is an astonishing demonstration of engineering mastery and environmental sustainability.  Many areas of the rice terraces have been declared a World Heritage Site under UNESCO.  Unfortunately,  some terrace locations have not been maintained due to a dwindling labour force and are slipping into decay.  The rice terraces are a real marvel to be cherished, and I hope that the Government of the Philippines will intervene to preserve and maintain these lands.

They are nearly 800 years old and have survived fires at the temple, multiple Japanese invasions, the Korean War, and the ravages of time and nature.\n\nJapan destroyed many historical buildings and artifacts during their invasion of the late 1500's, but this temple and the Tripitaka Koreana was spared. Japan returned to Korea in the early 1900's and destroyed much of what they failed to destroy the first time, but somehow these were spared again. When the Korean War broke out, more historical buildings and artifacts were destroyed. This temple in particular was slated to be bombed during the Korean War, but a pilot disregarded orders knowing there were important artifacts here. Not to mention the various fires that have destroyed other buildings at the temple, but somehow not the building that houses the Tripitaka Koreana.\n\nWhat makes these even more remarkable is how well preserved they are, nearly 800 years later. Making these wooden blocks ready for carving was an incredibly complicated and labor intensive process that took more than 5 years from the cutting down of the tree to carving the blocks. The blocks were treated with special varnish after being carved to discourage insects and were wrapped in metal to prevent warping. Even the building that housed them was designed to keep these blocks in pristine shape, based on its orientation, the size of its windows, and the materials used on the roofs and floors. They did such an amazing job that a modern building designed to store the blocks in perfect conditions actually caused damage to the blocks, causing them to be returned to their home of 700 years.\n\nJust an incredible piece of history in a country where so much of it was destroyed by war. Even though Haeinsa is a bit difficult to reach, it is absolutely worth visiting.",

Flashlights are recommended\u2014ones with a long beam would be worth it! We had small ones and our phones, which worked but didn\u2019t fully capture the depth of the darkness. My pictures don\u2019t do it justice\u2014it\u2019s much darker than it looks, so if you struggle to see in low light, bring something extra to illuminate parts of the path.\n\nAt the end of the trail, we took the option of 75-story elevator back up. The trails were busy, but people were respectful about photos and passing. There are gift shops at both the top and bottom, plus snacks underground.

The tour was quite interesting!  Dinner was superbly delicious.  The concept was spectacular! We had (VIP) front row seats for an 8-instrument performance with 2 opera singers.  It was truly amazing!  Well worth every penny!!",

But you always hear the high way where the cars making there own sound but still you feel happy peddling along the old Allees beside the water.\nThe following route to Carcassonne needed more Intension for the path it was paved with little stones, occasionally some roots and wholes make it difficult to bike fast.\nThe third part till Narbonne was even more difficult and because of some tree disease they had to cut almost all the old trees and planted new once but this couldn't give you an enjoyable feeling. The good part was that the high way was to fare away to hear.\nNevertheless the people you meet on the Canal Du Midi in Bike, Hiking or on a Boot are always very friendly and all in all take as much time you can to be able to explore the villages on the Canal try the good food and the great wine they produce in the area and look out that you have always enough water with you.",

Part of his success came from lessons he learned as a child hostage in Greece. He learned of the phalanx formation and the use of the long spear or pike called a sarissa which he brought to the Macedonian infantry. He also transformed the army with increased discipline and training. Under Phillip the soldiers were provided with the possibility of advancement through the ranks and were rewarded with bonuses and extra wages for exceptional service. All of this is reflected in this tomb of exceptional quality. This may be one of the best memorials I\u2019ve seen of a clearly beloved king and the father of a nation.

This stunning Byzantine church is a true masterpiece, filled with some of the most incredible mosaics I\u2019ve ever seen. From the moment you step inside, you\u2019re transported back in time, surrounded by vibrant colors and intricate designs that seem to shimmer and glow.\n\nThe mosaics in San Vitale are absolutely breathtaking, with scenes from the Bible and the lives of saints depicted in stunning detail. One of the most iconic mosaics is the Empress Theodora, who is depicted with such grandeur and elegance, showcasing the opulence of the Byzantine Empire. The mosaic of Emperor Justinian is equally impressive, with his regal presence immortalized in vibrant colors. These mosaics are not only beautiful but also a fascinating glimpse into the historical significance of the church during the 6th century.\n\nThe church\u2019s architecture is also exceptional, with its octagonal shape and elegant proportions creating a sense of harmony and balance. The central dome is particularly striking, and the light that filters through the windows gives the entire space a spiritual and ethereal quality.\n\nWhy It\u2019s My Favorite:\n\u2022\tThe mosaics are among the best-preserved examples of Byzantine art in the world.\n\u2022\tThe basilica\u2019s historical significance and architectural beauty make it an absolute must-see in Ravenna.\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s a peaceful and reflective space where you can immerse yourself in the art and history without the crowds of some of the more famous attractions.\n\nIf you\u2019re visiting Ravenna, San Vitale is a must-visit.

I am a history buff, adore Japanese culture and we wanted to pay our respects to a tragic chapter in human history. We have also been to Auschwitz in Poland and it is important to look the ugly parts of history in the eye, so that we are witnesses and never make that mistake again.\n\nThe most important thing that I took away from the Atomic Bomb memorial was the stately crane that was perched upon the dome while we were there. To me that was a symbol that life had returned to the lively, bustling, beautiful city of Hiroshima. If this memorial, and world heritage protected ruin, was not here, you would never know that an atomic bomb was dropped directly above it.\n\nMy favourite part of the memorial was the crane statue with the child holding a giant origami crane. The glass displays with all of the thousands of origami paper cranes that children have made to honour the victims was lovely to see. The peace symbols and signs made up of tiny cranes were very touching.\n\nLuckily for us, there were many Japanese school children on a field trip to see the memorial park that day. It was another sign of life reborn. I rang the bell to honour the victims. A truly lovely memorial and a wonderful way to honour the countless lost souls that were lost that sad day.",

It encompasses the tomb of Sultan Moulay Ismail, who governed Morocco from 1672 until his death in 1727, and is situated within the confines of his citadel. It is a notable historic and religious site in the city.\n\nThe funerary complex consists of various courtyards and chambers. The main central courtyard, located on the west side of the tomb chamber, is sparsely decorated except for a central fountain and pavement. The western and eastern sides of the courtyard are occupied by these horseshoe arches.\n\nBehind the courtyard's eastern wall are the mausoleum chamber and adjoining rooms.  An indoor patio or courtyard covered by a high amazingly beautiful cupola ceiling. The pavement and lower walls are decorated with zellij tilework that feature circular or radiating geometric patterns, typical of Moroccan architecture. At the center of the patio is an ornate fountain, and while the cupola ceiling above primarily features painted and carved wood. The wooden cupola ceiling and stucco-carved walls of the patio are remarkably stunning. The cupola is high enough to allow for windows that bring in natural light. Its beauty undoubtedly mesmerizes thousands of visitors.\n\nThe mausoleum is a square chamber which holds the tombstones of Moulay Isma'il.  The royal tombstones are made of marble and are richly carved with  Arabic calligraphic inscriptions.\n\nSimilar to other Moroccan cultural landmarks, images merely offer a glimpse of its beauty. To experience its beauty in its entirety, an on-site visit is required. Time constraints, such as what I  experienced with my tour group; limited the capture and sharing of only a few essential aspects of The Mausoleum of Moulay Isma'il.",

This modification adds the New Dutch Waterline to the existing Defence Line of Amsterdam World Heritage site, to become the Dutch Water Defence Lines World Heritage property and also includes a number of small extensions and reductions to the boundaries of the Defence Line of Amsterdam World Heritage property. In particular, the extension illustrates a single military defence system, which was based on inundation fields, hydraulic installations and on a series of fortifications and military posts stretching over an area of 85 km. It also includes three smaller components: Fort Werk IV, the Tiel Inundation Canal and Fort Pannerden near the German border. Built from 1814 to 1940, they complement the already inscribed site, which is\u00a0the only example of a fortification based on the principle of controlling the waters. Since the 16th century, the people of the Netherlands have used their expert knowledge of hydraulic engineering for defence purposes. The centre of the country was protected by a network of 45 armed forts, acting in concert with temporary flooding from polders and an intricate system of canals and locks.</p>",

Today they are still privately owned and people still use them to attend church it have family get together.\nThe museum explains it all and has great displays and even since film footage from the 1920\u2019s since they were used into the 1950\u2019s for their original purpose.

A bit beneath the main entrance you gonna find a lovely restaurant with as well a spectacular view and some gift shops and a picturesque Light House.",

It not only frequently competes with France's other famous landmark, Mont Saint-Michel, for the title of the most visited French attraction, but it has also become an inspiration for many creators, including the famous German board game Carcassonne and the popular Japanese anime Attack on Titan.\n\nCarcassonne is situated on a hill far from the city center, and from a distance, its distinctive towering city walls can be seen standing tall on the hill, creating an intimidating sense of awe. However, once you pass through the two high city walls, you are greeted by an unassuming, quaint medieval town. Life within the high walls feels surprisingly ordinary and almost imperceptible\u2014only those guarding the walls or those outside truly realize the fortress's towering, inaccessible presence.\n\nToday, Carcassonne has two main entrances. One is better preserved and features a statue of Dame Carcassonne, offering a clear view of the castle\u2019s double-layered wall structure. This entrance is also the most common one for tourists to enter the town. However, I personally recommend the entrance hidden at the back of the castle. Although the road here is more damaged and rugged, I feel it offers the most beautiful view of the castle and will undoubtedly satisfy the medieval knight spirit that lies deep within us all.",

When we finally decided to take the shuttle bus back to the entrance, the non-English-speaking driver gestured for us to sit down but never mentioned it was a paid service.

The circular layout, symbolizing the world, is divided into geometric sections filled with rare and exotic plants. One of its most famous residents is Goethe\u2019s Palm, planted in 1585, which inspired the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s studies on plant evolution.\n\nIn addition to its historical charm, the modern Biodiversity Garden showcases plants from all climate zones, housed in state-of-the-art glasshouses. The mix of ancient botanical heritage and innovative conservation efforts makes this garden one of the most unique in the world.\n\nA must-visit for plant lovers, history enthusiasts, and anyone looking for a peaceful retreat in Padua. Absolutely worth it \u2013 5/5!",

So disappointed.\nWe usually love visite botanical gardens whatever we travels but this one was absolutely shamble for the price we paid.\nAn example?

Unfortunately, the audio guides were disappointing because they talked too much about the family history and not enough about why the paint is still lasting and what the bodies mean,  how it happened. Etc Everything like that. For those who are interested in family history, I guess that\u2019s fine but for me I wanted to know more about the bricks they used and the bodies that were there and how they did things. I also would\u2019ve liked a video room that showed life in those days and the event of the volcano..  some rude tourist guides walking around-from seperate companies.

There are 12 remnant glaciers on the mountain, all receding rapidly, and four secondary peaks that sit at the head of the U-shaped glacial valleys. With its rugged glacier-clad summits and forested middle slopes, Mount Kenya is one of the most impressive landscapes in East Africa. The evolution and ecology of its afro-alpine flora provide an outstanding example of ecological and biological processes. Through the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and Ngare Ndare Forest Reserve, the property also incorporates lower lying scenic foothills and arid habitats of high biodiversity, situated in the ecological transition zone between the mountain ecosystem and the semi-arid savanna grasslands.

        "text": "Lumbini, Nepal, the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, offers a profoundly different airport experience than a large international hub. It's a place where the spiritual significance of the location overshadows the typical hustle and bustle of modern air travel. Let's delve into a review of the Lumbini Airport (Gautam Buddha International Airport).\n\nGautam Buddha International Airport (LUM) is relatively new and designed to facilitate pilgrimage and tourism to this sacred site. Stepping off the plane, you're immediately struck by the tranquil atmosphere, a stark contrast to the often frenetic energy of larger airports. The airport's design reflects the region's cultural heritage, with subtle nods to Buddhist architecture and symbolism.\n\nThe airport is small and manageable, making navigation straightforward. The check-in and security processes are generally efficient, though they may be less automated compared to larger airports. This simplicity adds to the overall sense of peace and tranquility that permeates the location.\n\nThe facilities at LUM are basic but adequate. You'll find essential amenities like restrooms, a small cafe, and a few souvenir shops. The emphasis is less on commercialism and more on providing a comfortable and respectful environment for pilgrims and visitors.\n\nThe airport's primary purpose is to connect visitors to the Lumbini Sacred Garden, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The proximity of the airport to this significant site is a major advantage, allowing for easy access to the temples, monasteries, and the Maya Devi Temple, the traditional birthplace of the Buddha.\n\nThe overall atmosphere at LUM is one of reverence and quiet contemplation. Passengers are often pilgrims from various Buddhist traditions, creating a sense of shared purpose and spiritual connection. The airport's staff is generally friendly and helpful, reflecting the warm hospitality of the Nepali people.\n\nWhile LUM may lack the extensive amenities and modern infrastructure of larger airports, it excels in its role as a gateway to a place of profound spiritual importance. The simplicity and tranquility of the airport experience complement the serene atmosphere of Lumbini itself.\n\nFor travelers seeking a spiritual journey or an immersion into Buddhist culture, Lumbini Airport provides a fitting introduction to this sacred destination. It is a place where the journey itself is as meaningful as the destination. It is a place where you will find peace.",

The Sacred Garden, with its beautiful trees, ponds, and quiet paths, creates a calm and reflective atmosphere perfect for meditation and contemplation.\n\nThe main highlight was visiting the Maya Devi Temple, where the stone marking the spot of Buddha's birth is kept. It\u2019s an awe-inspiring moment to stand in such a significant historical location. The surrounding monasteries, built by different countries, offer unique architectural styles and add to the global spiritual significance of Lumbini.\n\nThe area is well-maintained, and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, offering insights into the history and meaning behind the sites. While it can get busy, the spiritual energy of the place remains strong, and it\u2019s easy to find moments of solitude.\n\nIf you're looking for a peaceful and enlightening journey, Lumbini is the perfect place to reflect, connect with nature, and experience a piece of world history.

It\u2019s an entire city from 2,300 years ago, still there for you to explore: walk through its streets, visit houses, admire the intricate mosaics in the halls, temples, and public baths. Set aside at least 2 hours to visit and be ready to walk. Several temples dedicated to Roman mythology gods like Minerva, Pluto, and Saturn are there. All of this comes with incredible views of the region, with olive trees adding to the atmosphere of the time. And the amphitheater? It\u2019s a spectacle! I suggest starting at the lower part of Dougga and reaching the amphitheater from above for a breathtaking view. Don\u2019t miss the city\u2019s entrance with the two pillars that once supported the gate. Walk through the baths and wander the alleys between still-intact houses. Notice the water collection system that\u2019s still visible. Some English-speaking guides offer their services at the entrance, and I think it\u2019s worth it to learn more about the area\u2019s rich history. By Jupiter, what a place!",

The architecture in Holasovice is remarkably well-preserved, with traditional farmhouses and buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nOne of the highlights of visiting Holasovice is taking a leisurely stroll through the village streets. The layout of the village is quite fascinating, with houses arranged around a central square. The buildings are made of wood and feature beautiful facades with colorful decorations and ornate details. Walking through the streets feels like stepping back in time and offers a glimpse into the region's rich history and cultural heritage.",

We went to the C\u00f4a museum first (got there around 12pm and it was very quiet), strolled around for about 1h (entrance was 7\u20ac I think and we booked the guided tour to the rock art site - Penascosa - at the reception, which was another 16\u20ac). After the museum visit, we grabbed a bite at the museum restaurant which has a breathtaking view and delicious food! Next we drove to Castelo Melhor to the meeting point (a 15m drive). Our tour was at 15:45. Our guide was Marco Ferraz, he\u2019s the best! He is considerate, funny, great with children and can do the visit in English too if necessary. At the meeting point you can stock up on cold water. We highly recommend preparing for very very veeeeery hot and dry conditions - That means bring a hat, sun screen, sunnies, and of course a big bottle of water per person! We got to the site in a van with a total of 6 people including Marco the guide. I\u2019d say the rock art was the highlight of our visit to the northern interior of PT! I\u2019d also recommend visiting Penascosa at night, due to the extreme heat. Thanks again Marco!",

        "text": "Review of Peninsula Valdes\n\nThese are important notes on the current situation in Pen. Valdes in Patagonia. These are particularly for non-Spanish speaking visitors, where you won\u2019t understand fully the guidance you are being given.\n\nWe visited on 24th and 25th October 2024.\n\nThe coast road from Puerto Madryn to Playa Doradillo is closed on a 17km section. You cannot access Playa Doradillo from the south.\nYou can take Route 2 and turn off towards the coast and work your way back to Playa Canteras. You can\u2019t go any further south.\nWhales were viewable from the various beaches that were accessible.\n\nHigh tide is the time to go.\n\nContinuing into Pen. Valdes, you next meet the park gate where you pay for your ticket. A$30,000 per person and A$1,700 for a private car. You can get your tickets stamped at this location on the way out and you can access the park again within the next 7 days for free the 2nd time. You still need to pay the A$1,700 for the car each day.\n\nAfter the main entry, there is an information centre about 20kms further along where there are toilets, exhibitions and an information desk.\n\nThe one main road is paved all the way to Puerto Piramides. All other roads are unpaved gravel roads, of different levels of condition. The car can travel as slowly as 30kms per hour for some parts and as high as 70kms per hour on others. There are many iron grids at very regular intervals that you need to slow down to 40kms per hour to go over. Drive carefully throughout.\n\nThe lighthouse at Punta Delgado is currently closed \u201ctemporarily\u201d.  It is not clear when it will reopen. Based on this there is no reason to drive this road. There are NO access points to the beaches or cliffs anywhere on this road, all the way around to Caleta Valdes. You would be better off driving directly to Caleta Valdes and save time. There is a penguin viewing point at Caleta which gets you very close to the penguins and further south 5kms is a good centre with toilets and aa cafe to see  elephant seals, although they are about 50-100 metres away.\n\nThe road from Caleta to Punta Norte is also fully closed, so you need to track back inland to get the road to the North.\n\nWe went the 2nd day to the Punta Norte and had good views of elephant seals and seals. Didn\u2019t see any orcas, although they are in the area. It\u2019s pure chance if you see some.\n\nIt takes over an hour to get from one place to another - the distances are very long. There\u2019s a lot of time spent focusing on the road and seeing nothing but sheep (10 times more sheep than guanacos!).\n\nPuerto Piramides is a nice small village. All whale watching boats leave from here. The trips are weather dependent and I got to go out in the afternoon due to high winds in the morning. The rangers at the ticket gate warned us up front that the morning sailings weren\u2019t happening, which was helpful.\n\nThere is a good viewing spot for seal lions just outside of P. Piramides, with a sign saying \u201cMirador Balaena\u201d. We did not see any whales from this location.\n\nSeparately, if you\u2019re staying in Puerto Madryn, there is a good spot to see sea lions about 15kms south of P. Madryn, with an information centre. The last 5kms is a gravel road.\n\nThe amount of road closures and weather dependent activities means you should plan your trip carefully. If Delgado is still closed, you are far better off skipping that whole section entirely.",

        "text": "Our extra excursion through Infotur with Jes\u00fas and Orlando was great. We drove out of Havana via a different route than from the airport the previous night as was cool to see the city, the people, the colours and the buildings in sunshine.\n\nOnce on the motorway, we made pretty good progress although it was very weird overtaking small horse and cart vehicles because of the cost of buying and maintaining a car. Lots of people hitching along the roadside was explained as being due to amost non-existent publc transport.\n\nWe made good progress on the motorway and after a couple of hours stopped for a toilet and drinks break at Las Palmas roadside bar/restaurant/private accommodation where we learned two more Cuban lessons - 1. it is customary to pay a small amount to use the public toilets and there is usually a woman sitting outside as a guardian of the toilet paper, so you don't really have a choice. It was no problem doing so here, except we had no Pesos, as the toilets were spotless and 2, you can pay fot things in USD or EUR in most places and they have an exchange rate in CUP (300 to the Euro) so in the bar we ordered 2 drinks, paid in Euros, received our change in CUP, paid a relative pittance for the toilets and were ready to continue on to Vi\u00f1ales.\nOnce off the motorway, things were very different. The uncovered roads were terrible to be driven along in places with enormous potholes and general erosion due to the weather. This made for a very bouncy ride, so anyone prone to travel sickness should be wary. However, we drove through village after village on the outskirts of Vi\u00f1ales with brightly coloured houses, neat little gardens at the front. and probably fruit and vegetables growing at the rear. There were lots of well-fed dogs running around as well as goats and cattle. Once we were in Vi\u00f1ales itself the road improved and we stopped at a building that looked like the village church. Jes\u00fas got out of the minibus and went inside and after about 10 minutes came back out and beckoned us to go with him.\ninside the building there were rows of desks with a couple of women - they were all women - sitting in each row and which reminded me of a 1920s school. it turned out we were in a place where huge bundles of tobacco leaves would come straight from the farms/plantations and the women at the desks were sorting the leaves individually and by hand into 3 different types of leaf to be used in different stages of the cigar making process. A woman who seemed to be the boss and with whom Jes\u00fas was giving some paperwork gave us a very thorough explanation of the entire process. It was so educational that we didn't have any questions at the end. It was also a relief to get out and back into 34\u00ba heat as inside it felt much hotter and the humidity was so fierce, I was sweating rivers!\nNext, we continued up a mountain where we ere greeted with a small cocktail and allowed time to cool down from high above the famous Vi\u00f1ales Valley, which we were told dates from the Jurassic period. Just a shame there' so little fauna in Cuba. After having recovered from the tobacco experience, we went to see the Mural of Prehistory before having lunch beside it in what we would become used to in Cuba - very basic, but good quality food included for lunch every day, but no choices and no menus. Everyone gets the same. Before leaving I went to a real Cuban public toilet. Despite being part of the restaurant, I would soon get used to the dark, very humid cubicles often with no seat on the porcelain.re leaving.\nHeading back to Havana seemed a lot quicker than it felt heading to Vi\u00f1ales earlier in the day, but the potholes and bumpy roads were still there. On the motorway we got caught in a torrential downpour which required Orlando to improvise repairs to the windscreen wipers as the rain was too hard for them. He managed to do this and get us back to Havana and the enormous puddles that had overflowed the drains. Now I found out the answer to a question I'd been meaning to ask about why the kerbs are so high!",

One of the region's agricultural and administrative centres, it has been a melting pot for local and immigrant populations. Cuenca's architecture, much of which dates from the 18th century, was 'modernized' in the economic prosperity of the 19th century as the city became a major exporter of quinine, straw hats and other products.</p>",

Opened in 1881, its design applies bold and ingenious engineering solutions to the problem of establishing an effective rail link across a mountainous terrain of great beauty. The construction of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 46-km long metre-gauge single-track railway in Tamil Nadu State was first proposed in 1854, but due to the difficulty of the mountainous location the work only started in 1891 and was completed in 1908. This railway, scaling an elevation of 326 m to 2,203 m, represented the latest technology of the time. The Kalka Shimla Railway, a 96-km long, single track working rail link built in the mid-19th century to provide a service to the highland town of Shimla is emblematic of the technical and material efforts to disenclave mountain populations through the railway. All three railways are still fully operational.</p>",

The locals here clearly loved shells and starfish\u2014so many were found! Some of the starfish sculptures even look like car wheel covers. \ud83d\ude06\n\nAlongside the usual small figurines and ceramics typical of central Mexico, there are some unique pieces I\u2019ve never seen anywhere else\u2014like a crescent moon with its horns facing up, a ceremonial crown, and what appears to be sculpted ceremonial attire. There\u2019s also a model of Ehecatl\u2019s temple pyramid.\n\nEntrance to both the museum and the pyramids is 100 pesos, and you can pay by card. A win!\n\nBy the way, the museum is about a kilometer away from the main archaeological site, and the path is uphill\u2014if you can, drive up instead of walking.\n\nNow, about Xochicalco itself\u2014where do I even begin? Is it the breathtaking view from the mountain, stretching across the valley from edge to edge? The mirror-like lake? The distant towns? The rugged peaks? Truly stunning. Eagles soar overhead, adding to the dramatic scenery.\n\nClimbing the monuments is no longer allowed, though some structures, like the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, are partially accessible. This temple has unique panels with incredibly high relief carvings that are beautifully preserved\u2014you can see every detail.\n\nWe kept wandering through the ruins, and they just never seemed to end. Temples, pyramids, overgrown paths, piles of stones with trees growing on them, a ball court with two preserved stands, and in the center, two rings still in place for the game. I could go on and on, but just trust me\u2014this place is worth it.\n\nXochicalco is way more impressive than Templo Mayor, and I\u2019d rank it right after Teotihuacan\u2014maybe even on par with it. The site is peaceful, with no noise, no pushy vendors, and barely any other visitors.\n\nHighly recommended! Just a heads-up\u2014if you plan to visit Cuernavaca and Xochicalco in one day, be prepared for a fast-paced trip and an early start. While they look close on the map, driving through the mountains isn\u2019t quick, especially on the way back to Mexico City. Splitting the trip into two days would be ideal.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest\u2014the real highlight isn\u2019t the museum (as great as it is) but the archaeological site itself!",

From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the stunning landscape of lush greenery and towering limestone cliffs. The boat ride to the cave entrance was filled with the sounds of nature, making us feel connected to the environment. Our knowledgeable guides passionately shared insights about the ecosystem and the need to protect this unique habitat, which was both educational and inspiring for our children.\n\nInside the cave, we marveled at the breathtaking rock formations and the serene beauty of the subterranean river. The reflections on the water and the impressive stalactites and stalagmites left us in awe. It was a wonderful opportunity for our family to bond while learning about geology and the importance of sustainability.\n\nWhat stood out most was the eco-friendly approach to tourism; the careful management of the site ensures its preservation for future generations. Knowing that our visit contributed to conservation efforts made the experience even more meaningful.\nOverall, the Subterranean River is a must-visit for families, offering a perfect blend of adventure, education, and appreciation for nature.

First part of the tour was a bit boring, as you are on a bus for a little over an hour and mostly viewing the village outside the prison. They talked a bit about Mandela, but I wish they spent more time on that history.",

The dense prairies of oceanic Posidonia (seagrass), an important endemic species found only in the Mediterranean basin, contain and support a diversity of marine life. Ibiza preserves considerable evidence of its long history. The archaeological sites at Sa Caleta (settlement) and Puig des Molins (necropolis) testify to the important role played by the island in the Mediterranean economy in protohistory, particularly during the Phoenician-Carthaginian period. The fortified Upper Town (Alta Vila) is an outstanding example of Renaissance military architecture; it had a profound influence on the development of fortifications in the Spanish settlements of the New World.</p>",

Upon arrival we were greeted with air conditioning (which was highly needed and very appreciated) and very friendly staff. The actual museum itself is very clean, easy to understand and has a beautiful collection of Roman , Punic and Phoenician history. We took our time looking around but staff was always seconds away if we had any questions. Also wanted to mention that there are kids tables with colouring activities to keep little ones occupied, but the artefacts are interesting enough by themselves in my opinion. After we toured the inside of the museum, we headed outside to see the necropolis, but my favourite part had to be the underground section where you could climb down into and see the tombs. Heading back inside , we were greeted by the same lovely staff (who i forgot to mention speak great English) and not only did they call a taxi for us, they also provided us with water while we waited. The souvenirs here are some of the cheapest and nicest ive seen out of the European countries ive visited and there really is something for everyone. The staff also refused to take any sort of tip or donation. They seemed genuinely happy to do their job and have people enjoy and learn history. Ontop of everything else, it was all completely free. Its a real shame it was so empty (we were obviously grateful to have it all to ourselves though) because it really is worth visiting. It was a perfect way to end our week in ibiza and would highly recommend.",

I suggest starting the day early to make the most out of it. There are various lookouts with terrains of different difficulty level. Do Google and research prior to going. Some are not wheelchair-friendly.\n\nDo remember to put on sunscreen if you are visiting in the summer. Hats, sunglasses and insect repellent are highly recommended especially if you have young kids. Wear comfortable shoes as there will be a lot of walking, climbing up and down the steps and walking on uneven surfaces. Do stock up on drinks and snacks/light bites as most places do not have shops. There are grocery markets and cafes/restaurants within the small towns though they do close early.\n\nCheck-out online if the places you intend to visit has a picnic area/waterfall area for a quick swim.

So I went back on Sunday, when their website says it is free to visit (quote: 'Free admission on the first Sunday of the month (excluding public holidays)'. I checked all over the website for a phone number as I wanted to double-check with them, and THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER on https://www.hortamuseum.be/en/Welcome. So I took the time to go to the museum to visit, just to be turned away in a rude manner by the man at the entrance, because even if it is free to visit, it appears you still need to book in advance (THIS SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN A CLEAR WAY). The couple who walked in after me were turned away for the same reason. The museum clearly needs to provide better information.

They feature rich decoration of stone statues and carvings and tiles with dragon motifs, illustrating the development of the funerary architecture of the Qing Dynasty. The three tomb complexes, and their numerous edifices, combine traditions inherited from previous dynasties and new features of Manchu civilization.</p>",

As I approached the basilica, nestled atop the gentle hills of Assisi, the surrounding landscape created a sense of calm, framing the basilica in a way that felt almost sacred. The architecture, with its Gothic arches and stunning facade, immediately drew me in, setting the tone for a truly moving visit.\n\nInside, the Upper Basilica was a marvel, with frescoes by Giotto that bring to life the story of Saint Francis in vibrant detail. Each scene was rich with color and emotion, capturing his life\u2019s journey and conveying his humility and compassion. Walking through, I felt as if I was stepping into the past, experiencing history through the artists\u2019 vision and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Lower Basilica, by contrast, was more intimate and serene. Standing near Saint Francis\u2019s tomb, surrounded by people from all walks of life, was incredibly humbling. The silence in that space was profound, and I felt a shared reverence with everyone around me. It was a reminder of the enduring impact of Saint Francis\u2019s message of love, peace, and respect for all creation.\n\nThe experience as a whole was both uplifting and grounding. The Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi is not just a place of worship; it\u2019s a timeless testament to kindness, humility, and the power of faith to bring people together across centuries.",

The Walls are built of internal and external stone facings of slate with some granite, with a core filling of a conglomerate of slate slabs and worked stone pieces from Roman buildings, interlocked with lime mortar.\n\nTheir total length of 2117 m in the shape of an oblong rectangle occupies an area of 1.68 ha.

The walls still contain 85 external towers, 10 gates (five of which are original and five that were opened in modern times), four staircases and two ramps providing access to the walkway along the top of the walls, one of which is internal and the other external. Each tower contained access stairs leading from the intervallum to the wall walk of town wall, of which a total of 21 have been discovered to date.\n\nThe defences of Lugo are the most complete and best preserved example of Roman military architecture in the Western Roman Empire.\n\nDespite the renovation work carried out, the walls conserve their original layout and the construction features associated with their defensive purpose, with walls, battlements, towers, fortifications, both modern and original gates and stairways, and a moat.",

The 5,600 islands of the Kvarken Archipelago feature unusual ridged washboard moraines, &lsquo;De Geer moraines&rsquo;, formed by the melting of the continental ice sheet, 10,000 to 24,000 years ago. The Archipelago is continuously rising from the sea in a process of rapid glacio-isostatic uplift, whereby the land, previously weighed down under the weight of a glacier, lifts at rates that are among the highest in the world. As a consequence islands appear and unite, peninsulas expand, and lakes evolve from bays and develop into marshes and peat fens. The High Coast has also been largely shaped by the combined processes of glaciation, glacial retreat and the emergence of new land from the sea. Since the last retreat of the ice from the High Coast 9,600 years ago, the uplift has been in the order of 285 m which is the highest known ''rebound''. The site affords outstanding opportunities for the understanding of the important processes that formed the glaciated and land uplift areas of the Earth''s surface.</p>",

In summer, we're tilted toward the sun, but the equinox is right in between.

The best time to visit is sunrise. This is a place that is usually very busy on weekends so it is advisable to schedule your arrival during the week.\nThere are a few ways to get up:\n1. Snake path - This is the long path up to the mountain.\n\u2022Length: The route climbs to a height of 350 meters, and is 2.7 Km long.\n\u2022Opens for ascent every day one hour before Sunrise and closes for descent one hour before closing time.\n\u2022On very hot days the Snake Path ascent closes at 09:00AM and the descent closes at 10:00AM. When heat is extreme, the Snake Path ascent closes at 08:00 and the decent closes at 09:00. The descent via the Roman Ramp is open as usual.\n2. The Roman ramp path - This is the short path.\nStarting point: West entrance.\n\u2022Length: 0.7 Kilometers\n3. Cable car - A round trip by cable car will cost 23$.\n\u2022 You need to make a reservation!\n\u2022Starts working at 8AM!",

The vibrant colors dancing across the Dead Sea, coupled with the peaceful silence of the desert, created a truly magical atmosphere. It was a moment that will forever be etched in my memory.\n\nExploring the site, we marveled at the well-preserved structures, including the ancient synagogue, bathhouses, and the imposing palaces. The views from the summit were simply breathtaking, offering a breathtaking panorama of the desert landscape and the Dead Sea in the distance.\n\nMasada National Park\u2019s commitment to preservation and conservation is evident throughout. The efforts to protect and restore this historical gem are commendable, allowing visitors to step back in time and appreciate the remarkable heritage that unfolds within these ancient walls.\n\nI highly recommend visiting Masada National Park to anyone with an interest in history, nature, or simply seeking a unique and memorable experience. The combination of historical significance, stunning landscapes, and a well-organized visitor experience make it a must-see destination.\n\nA trip to Masada National Park is an unforgettable journey that will leave you with a profound appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit and the natural beauty of the Israeli desert.

They mean they are already locked up, cleaned up and going home at that time. So they will walk you out of the gardens 15 minutes early and just push you straight on out of the house. So you are out of the house before 5. :00. Even though that's supposedly the closing time. That was the only negative part of our experience. The garden's really were lovely to go see.

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and holds significant cultural, historical, and spiritual importance for the Malagasy people.\n\nHere are some key details about Rovan' Ambohimanga:\n\n1. Historical Significance: Ambohimanga was once the residence of the Merina kings and queens, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries. It served as a royal settlement and spiritual center, playing a central role in the history of the Merina Kingdom, one of the most influential kingdoms on the island.\n\n2. Royal Hill: The site is situated on a hill, offering spectacular views of the surrounding area, and it includes a combination of a royal palace, tombs, sacred places, and a fortified town. The hill itself is considered a sacred site and a symbol of the royal heritage of Madagascar.\n\n3. Cultural Heritage: The palace complex at Ambohimanga includes traditional Malagasy architectural features, such as wooden palaces and stone walls. It is an excellent example of pre-colonial architecture and represents the culture and governance of the Merina people.\n\n4.

We were quite impressed even during that short visit, and decided to revisit.\n\nToday, we spent an entire day there:\n- Reached early(0950), and viewed the sites like Creutz shaft, hoist, etc.\n- Visited the museum, viewed  partially but thoroughly.\n- Lunch at the cafe. We avoided the restaurant this time as the menu didn't suit us but based on our 2022 visit, I would say the restaurant is decent and reliable.\n- Guided tour in English at 1330. We actually had booked a Swedish tour as the English one at 1200 was full. During our interaction with reception, they informed us that there would be an additional English tour at 1330 due several visitors.\n- Revisited and covered the remaining part of the museum.\n- Left around 1600.\n\nThe museum is the best part, followed by the 1h guided tour. They have taken utmost efforts to provide information on English. The guides and the staff provided some interesting information apart from the tour as well. The kids also enjoyed a lot.\n\nOverall, it is a must-visit sight if you are in Sweden even for a brief period.",

The site provides an outstanding example of the formation of the High Alps, including the most glaciated part of the mountain range and the largest glacier in Eurasia. It features a wide diversity of ecosystems, including successional stages due particularly to the retreat of glaciers resulting from climate change. The site is of outstanding universal value both for its beauty and for the wealth of information it contains about the formation of mountains and glaciers, as well as ongoing climate change. It is also invaluable in terms of the ecological and biological processes it illustrates, notably through plan succession. Its impressive landscape has played an important role in European art, literature, mountaineering and alpine tourism.</p>",

The architecture is distinct, with traditional grass-thatched huts that symbolize the rich cultural heritage of the Buganda Kingdom. The guides were incredibly knowledgeable and gave in-depth explanations about the history of the kings buried here, the importance of each structure, and the cultural rituals still practiced today.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the site is undergoing restoration, following a tragic fire that damaged the main building a few years back. While this is important for preserving the site, it might limit some areas for exploration. Despite this, the visit remains impactful, offering a glimpse into Uganda\u2019s royal history and cultural practices.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning about Uganda\u2019s heritage and history, I highly recommend visiting the Kasubi Tombs.

        "text": "This national park lies on the plains at the heart of Europe. It can be reached from both Austria and Hungary, and the lake is proof that nature knows no boundaries. The park aims for the long-term            preservation of habitats for a wide variety of bird and plant life in the area where the Alps meet the Euro-Asiatic plains.\n\nWater, rippling reed beds, small fields with flat saltwater pools, this is the Neusiedler Lakes National Park. The Pannonian climate, withdrawal of its long growing period and its position between the Alps and the Puszta, determines the type of plant\nlife: dry meadows surrounded by wetlands and salt marshes. The National Park is full of wildlife, mainly birds: meadow sandpipers, geese, herons, storks, curlews, and birds of prey.\nLarge parts of the National Park are extre- mely important for the migration of birds. The meadows and marshes are places where many migratory species choose to rest in winter. European reports into endangered bird species refer to the\nimportance of the Neusiedler Lake Area. The work of the National Park is also important to preserve this bird paradise, which draws birds from across the globe.\n\nIn conservation areas, people should be allowed to make use of the land to educational and leisure purposes. People who live in the region, holiday-makers, or people on day trips are asked to treat nature's creatures with consideration in\nreturn to what has now become a rare natural experience. Nature needs a\nhome, but man\nshould not lose their place in nature.\n\nThe combination of the original natural landscape and man-made landscape provides for a wide variety of plant and animal life that is unparalleled in Europe. Being located where several climatic\nzones meet, the area is home to Alpine species as well as those from the Mediterranean and Central Asia. Scientists have long since made the National-Park area into an open-air laboratory on\nwhich their research is focused.\n\nConservationists and scientists had wanted a National Park in the Neusiedler Lakes Area for decades. The joint Austrian - Hungarian planning commission formed in 1987 has operated across national boundaries. Negotiations with the government of the Republic of Hungary took five years, and once the contracts had been signed,\nthe Regional Parliament of Burgenland was able to pass the National Park Act in November 1992.\n\nA major duty of the National Park is the\npreservation of a natural landscape where\nhumans no longer make use of the land, but\ninstead, nature has been allowed to take over again. For example, the area of small, shallow saltwater pools with reed beds and wide meadows supports a variety of animal and plant life, which were for centuries, used for cattle and hay-making.",

The intricate carvings, the Vajrasana (Diamond Throne), and the Lotus Pond added to the serene atmosphere.\n\nDespite the crowd, the temple maintained a tranquil charm. The cool January weather made the visit even more pleasant. Highly recommended for anyone seeking peace, history, and spirituality.\n\n\u2b50 Rating: 5/5 \u2013 A must-visit for enlightenment and tranquility!",

        "text": "The Buddha of Bamyan, located in the Bamyan Valley in central Afghanistan, was once one of the most magnificent and revered archaeological sites in the world. These monumental statues, carved into the cliffs of the Hindu Kush mountains, were a symbol of Afghanistan\u2019s rich cultural and religious history. The statues, dating back to the 6th century, depicted two colossal figures of the Buddha, standing at 55 meters and 37 meters tall, making them among the largest Buddha statues in the world. The Bamyan Buddhas represented the fusion of Gandhara and Buddhist art and were a testament to Afghanistan's role as a crossroads of trade, culture, and religion, where Buddhist influence thrived. These sculptures, along with the surrounding caves and frescoes, painted a vivid picture of a prosperous, peaceful society where Buddhism flourished long before the region's conversion to Islam.\n\nTragically, in 2001, the Taliban destroyed these priceless statues, sparking international outrage and leaving a permanent scar in the cultural heritage of the world. Despite this, the Buddha of Bamyan remains a symbol of resilience, representing the endurance of cultural identity and the importance of preserving global heritage for future generations.\n\nFor centuries, the Buddha of Bamyan attracted pilgrims, travelers, and scholars alike, serving as a crucial point along the ancient Silk Road. However, the arrival of Islam and the subsequent spread of Islamic influence in Afghanistan dramatically reshaped the region's religious and cultural landscape. As Islam gradually became the dominant religion in the region, Buddhism, along with other pre-Islamic practices, started to decline. By the 10th century, Buddhist influence had significantly waned, but the Bamyan Buddha statues remained as a silent reminder of the region's past. The statues endured until 2001 when the Taliban destroyed them, declaring them un-Islamic. The destruction of these iconic figures sparked global outrage and highlighted the tension between Afghanistan\u2019s ancient religious history and the modern Islamic identity that had taken root in the region.\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in the region, followed by the eventual rise of Islam, marked a profound shift in Afghanistan\u2019s spiritual identity. The destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas in 2001, during the rule of the Taliban, underscored the complex relationship between Afghanistan\u2019s Islamic present and its pre-Islamic past. While the Buddha statues are no longer standing, they remain a poignant reminder of the region's rich cultural diversity and the destructive consequences of cultural erasure.\n\nThe Buddha of Bamyan, though destroyed, continues to hold deep cultural, historical, and symbolic significance. Its once towering presence in the Bamyan Valley was a testament to the region\u2019s rich Buddhist heritage and its importance in the ancient Silk Road. The destruction of the statues in 2001 was a devastating loss not only for Afghanistan but for the global community, as it marked the erasure of a key piece of humanity\u2019s shared history. However, the site remains a symbol of resilience, with ongoing efforts to preserve and protect the area and its history. Today, the remnants of the Buddha of Bamyan continue to draw attention to the importance of cultural preservation, and the site stands as a reminder of the enduring value of history, art, and heritage, despite the challenges faced by the region. It is a powerful reminder of the need to protect cultural sites, ensuring that future generations can witness the richness of our shared past.",

Culturally it seems more similar to Bolivia which you are not too far from the border.\n\nIt's a fairly easy drive from the Salta Airport to Tilcara or even just all the way to Hornocal or Humahuaca.\n\nThis was one of our favorite times in all of Argentina.\n\nIt's much larger in person than we thought and the colors are fairly vibrant.\n\nKeep in mind the elevation is higher than Machu Picchu so drink some local coca tea and bring chocolate before you go!\n\nAli (my wife) almost fainted so that's the one down side. There's literally an ambulance waiting at the top because heart problems are so frequent.\n\nAlso, people will tell you that you need to rent a tour from Humahuaca but that's a lie - you can DEFINITELY drive yourself.\n\nThe roads are gravel from Humahuaca to Hornocal but absolutely doable even in a sedan like we had. Just drive a bit slow and you'll get there in 40 min - 1 hour.\n\nBetween the food, local arts & crafts, views, and overall vibe this is a 10/10 experience in Argentina and HIGHLY recommend!\n\nFull video review @Hobarts Abroad YouTube and TikTok",

They close between 12-1pm for lunch. If you do arrive when they are closed come back later or the next day.\n\nI stayed at the Southern end, Wilardi, as it was closer to the heli flights.

The site is situated on the west bank of the Tigris River and was once the capital of the Assyrian Empire, known as Assur or Ashur. The ancient city of Assur was founded around the 3rd millennium BCE and served as a major political, religious, and cultural center of the Assyrian Empire until its decline in the 7th century BCE.The castle itself is a testament to the architectural prowess of the Assyrians. It is characterized by its strategic location, which provided natural defenses against invasions. The remnants of the castle include fortifications, walls, and various administrative and religious buildings. One of the notable structures within the site is the ziggurat, a massive terraced structure that served as a temple dedicated to the god Ashur, the chief deity of the Assyrians.Throughout its history, Assur underwent several phases of construction and reconstruction, reflecting the changing dynamics of power and influence within the Assyrian Empire. The site also contains inscriptions and artifacts that offer insights into the administrative practices, religious beliefs, and daily life of the ancient Assyrians.In modern times, Assur Castle and the surrounding archaeological site have been recognized for their historical significance. The site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003, highlighting its importance to the cultural heritage of humanity. However, the site has faced threats from conflict and looting, particularly during periods of instability in Iraq.Efforts are ongoing to preserve and protect Assur Castle and its archaeological treasures. Scholars and archaeologists continue to study the site, uncovering new information about the ancient Assyrian civilization and its contributions to human history. Assur Castle remains a symbol of the rich cultural and historical legacy of Mesopotamia.",

This mausoleum is not only a brilliant architectural gem of Kazakhstan but also a spiritual center for the entire Turkic world.\n\nIntroduction and Historical Background\n\nKhoja Ahmed Yasavi was a renowned 12th-century Sufi mystic and Islamic philosopher. He holds a revered position in the Turkic world and is honored as the \"Saint of the Turks.\" Yasavi not only spread Islam but also integrated Sufi thought into Turkic culture. His mausoleum was ordered to be built in the 14th century by Timur the Great to honor Yasavi\u2019s contributions to the Islamization of the Turkic people.\n\nAs you can see, this mausoleum is tall and magnificent, following the typical Timurid architectural style that blends elements from Persian, Mongolian, and Central Asian cultures. The massive dome of the main hall is the largest still standing in Central Asia, rising to an impressive height of 44 meters, symbolizing reverence for the heavens.\n\nLegends and Anecdotes\n\nNow, let me share a few lesser-known stories with you to add some extra charm.\n\nThe first story involves Timur the Great. It is said that before deciding to construct the mausoleum, Timur had a dream in which Khoja Ahmed Yasavi appeared and instructed him to build the mausoleum. Yasavi told Timur that only his hands could complete this sacred task, and that this mausoleum would become one of the holiest structures in Central Asia. To honor this vision, Timur not only personally oversaw the design but also considered the construction a divine mission.\n\nAnother interesting story is about the large bronze cauldron inside the mausoleum, known as the Taizka Taurkhan. This 2-ton cauldron was used for religious ceremonies involving water, but locals believe it possesses miraculous healing powers. One devout believer is said to have taken a cup of water from the cauldron and cured their long-standing eye ailment. Since then, many pilgrims have come hoping to drink from the cauldron, praying for health and blessings.\n\nCultural and Architectural Highlights\n\nAs you approach the main entrance, you will notice the intricately tiled walls of the mausoleum. These tiles are not only beautiful but also feature complex mathematical patterns that symbolize the order of the universe. No two tiles share the same design, representing the uniqueness and harmony of all things. The blue and green hues, in particular, signify life and eternity, resonating with the Central Asian people's reverence for nature.\n\nIn addition to its visual splendor, the design of the mausoleum is highly functional. The temperature inside the main hall is well-regulated, allowing you to feel cool even during the hot summer months. This is due to the walls and dome's thoughtful design, which facilitates natural air circulation throughout the structure.\n\nA Lesser-Known Story\n\nFinally, there is a rare story that reveals the deep emotional connection between this building and the local people. According to legend, when Timur built the mausoleum, he ordered a stone tablet to be placed at the center of the main hall, symbolizing that Yasavi\u2019s spirit would forever be at the heart of the Turkic world. Interestingly, this stone has remained immovable to this day\u2014no matter how much effort is made, it seems to hold a mysterious \"weight,\" as if Yasavi's soul continues to watch over this sacred place.\n\nI hope these stories have provided you with a richer understanding of the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi. Here, history and legend intertwine, and each brick and tile holds deep cultural and religious significance. If you take the time to approach it closely, you might even feel the transcendent power that connects past and present.",

The park is well kept although it is clear that they are falling behind on the maintenance part of the park. We stayed in different camps during our visit and even the chalets are in need of general maintenance such as ceiling fans which are not working, a kettle which is out of order and our geyser in the tented camp did not work. The office number at the main gate seems to be almost permanently out of order and due to the long distance between the various camps and the main gate it is not always easy to drive back to the main gate office after reaching your camp to report a maintenance issue. The prices are not exactly cheap so we expect everything to be in a working condition. It would help a lot if the cleaning staff or maintenance staff can check that all lights, equipment, geysers, aircons, etc inside the chalets/tents are in working order before the next guest arrives. They are busy upgrading the tents in the tented camp which is a plus and a huge improvement. Despite the minor maintenance issues we enjoyed our stay of 4 days at Mapungubwe and will visit again soon. I include some pictures of the tented camp and I will also be doing a review on Leokwa Camp where we also stayed over.",

You should have contact your homestay or hotel, they will pick you up at the airport, train or bus station.\nFor food, there are a few options for western foods; Google is your best friend to search a place to eat. We stayed at the Sondoong homestay within walking distance to the boat ride to phong Nha cave.\nAnother good option is the Victoria Road homestay next door to Sondoong homestay. The Victoria is owned by an Australian with lots of experience exploring phong nha by bike.\nThe restaurant is pretty nice and cozy with some good western dishes and decent pizzas. There are also other places but this is the only places we ate during our time here.\nThere are a lot of places to stay in ph\u1ecdng nha, many tours are offered to fit your schedule. Overall, there is no 5 star accommodation and be prepared for the unexpected. But I can assure you this is a well worthy trip and enlighten your perspective.\nThe scenery is beautiful and truly reflect the live of the rural vietnam. This lifestyle has not changed for the last 60 years.\nLife is still tough for a lots of local people, tourism brings some relief to this corner of the world and they are welcome and appreciated.\nI also wanted to visit the demarcation line separated the north and south up to 1975. I have to say, for me at least, is a disappointment. The bridge is in shameful, neglected conditions with pealed paints, rotten wood planks on both sides of the bridges. I am not sure how to interpret the intentions here. Like it or not, this is a piece of history should be preserved. Either maintain it or tear it down !\nFor history bluffs, this city in right on the Ho Chi Minh trail, the road the north Vietnamese armies and supplies were moving south to attack the southern government. The old dirt roads are paved now but i can tell it is not a smooth road even today; small road barely fit 2 cars in opposite directions.\nFrom here you can visit Khe Sanh, where some well known battle grounds took place during the so called American war. Sorry I can\u2019t help to draw a comparison to the south Vietnamese situation then and the Ukrainian ones now; they all relied on the support of the American and at the mercy of the support of the American politicians who only cares about themselves and/or their idiotic party lines. They withholding the last aid in 1975 and eventually abandoned the South. I hope the Ukrainian will fare better this time.\n\nKhe Sanh is now a city, I found virtually nobody has any knowledge about the war.\nIf you want to know more or feel adventurous, the owner of Victoria Road can help fulfill your quest.\nI loved this trip. It is a bit rough for us, since she is wheelchair bound but we made it",

Diverse marine life flourished within this lagoon, including reptiles, fish, bivalves, ammonites, echinoderms and crustaceans.

Located in the Great Lakes Basin, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. The name \u201cUvs\u201d is supplemented with the qualifying word \u201cnuur\u201d, which means \u201clake\u201d - this is due to the traditions of the Mongolian language. The Great Lakes Basin is located in the northwestern part of Mongolia and is an intermountain depression hidden among mountains, ridges and spurs.\nUvs Nuur is the lowest point in Mongolia, height above sea level - 759 meters. The lake has a very high salt content, unsuitable for edible fish. 38 rivers flow into Uvs-Nuur and not a single one flows out. The lake deltas are a wonderful habitat for birds, of which there are more than 360 species! Seagulls, cranes, geese, swans, spoonbills, herons and partridges come here to bask during the harsh winter. Reed thickets, salt marshes, thickets of willows and aspens serve as a haven for them. The birds are accompanied by mammals, including such rare animals as the Siberian mountain goat, snow leopard and aragli.\nThe weather here is extreme - in summer the temperature rises to +40 degrees, in winter it drops to -57. But it is most optimal to study climate change under such conditions. Thanks to the unique hydrology of the basin, which includes mountains and rivers, scientists can calculate changes in salt content in the lake. The basin is surrounded by a dozen environmental protection zones. There are many ecosystems with specific climatic conditions, flora and fauna. If anyone has not yet visited this picturesque and beautiful place, I advise you not to delay but to get ready this year. I wish you to enjoy all the beauties of breathing fresh and clean air.",

Sermeq Kujalleq is one of the fastest and most active glaciers in the world. It annually calves over 35 km3 of ice, i.e. 10% of the production of all Greenland calf ice and more than any other glacier outside Antarctica. Studied for over 250 years, it has helped to develop our understanding of climate change and icecap glaciology. The combination of a huge ice-sheet and the dramatic sounds of a fast-moving glacial ice-stream calving into a fjord covered by icebergs makes for a dramatic and awe-inspiring natural phenomenon.</p>",

Particularly noteworthy vestiges in the 160-ha site include: the Mausoleum of Cyrus II; Tall-e Takht, a fortified terrace; and a royal ensemble of gatehouse, audience hall, residential palace and gardens. Pasargadae was the capital of the first great multicultural empire in Western Asia. Spanning the Eastern Mediterranean and Egypt to the Hindus River, it is considered to be the first empire that respected the cultural diversity of its different peoples. This was reflected in Achaemenid architecture, a synthetic representation of different cultures.</p>",

Distributed among 48 complexes with associated settlements and burial grounds, they are testimonies to the husbandry, social organization and rituals of pastoral peoples. Human settlements in the site are often multilayered and show occupation through the ages. A huge number of ancient tombs are also to be found including stone enclosures with boxes and cists (middle and late Bronze Age), and mounds (kurgans) of stone and earth (early Iron Age to the present). The central canyon contains the densest concentration of engravings and what are believed to be altars, suggesting that these places were used for sacrificial offerings.</p>",

Known for its ancient petroglyphs, this site features carvings that date back to as early as the Bronze Age. The most famous petroglyphs are depictions of Buddha and various deities, making it a significant site for followers of Buddhism, but the rock carvings also include scenes of animals, hunting, and daily life from ancient civilizations. The name \"Tamgaly-Tas\" translates to \"rocks with signs\" or \"inscribed stones,\" which is fitting for a site rich in symbolic and historical meanings.\n\nIn addition to its archaeological importance, Tamgaly-Tas is a place of natural beauty. It\u2019s surrounded by rugged landscapes and the scenic Ili River, making it a popular destination for nature enthusiasts, historians, and spiritual pilgrims alike. The area offers visitors a peaceful and contemplative atmosphere, enhanced by the serene flow of the river and the majestic, weathered cliffs.

The rock art seems to have Buddhist influence though there are animals and humans depicted too, like in some prehistoric sites in India and elsewhere. It is similar to what we have in Bhimbetka, and Robertsganj in India. River Illysk (they call it Illi) flows in the Tanbaly gorge and presents a spectacular view.\n\nI hired a taxi and did a day trip to the beautiful Tanbaly gorge. Oraz -the taxi guy spoke some working English so the time wasn't boring. Usually there is an entrance ticket and also a parking fee but the day I went was the day of garbage clearance and the site was closed for tourists. There were school children and teachers who were doing this volunteer service. So I had free entry and an opportunity to interact with the volunteers.

There are fishing villages, quays, warehouses, eider houses (built for eider ducks to nest in), farming landscapes, lighthouses and beacons. There is evidence of human settlement from the Stone Age onwards. By the 9th century, the islands had become an important centre for the supply of down, which appears to have accounted for around a third of the islanders\u2019 income. The Vega Archipelago reflects the way fishermen/farmers have, over the past 1,500 years, maintained a sustainable living and the contribution of women to eiderdown harvesting.</p>",

        "text": "Nestled in the heart of the Caribbean, the island of Saint Lucia is renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty, and Gros Piton is undoubtedly one of its crown jewels. During my two years on this stunning island, Gros Piton became more than just a destination for me; it was an escape, a source of thrill, and a place where I felt a renewed sense of wonder with every visit.\n\nA World Heritage Wonder\n\nDesignated as a UNESCO World Heritage site, Gros Piton is an iconic landmark that dominates the landscape of Saint Lucia. Rising majestically above the sea, it offers unparalleled views and a sense of awe that words often fail to capture. Whether you see it from a boat, the roadside, or the summit itself, the sheer grandeur of this volcanic peak leaves an indelible mark on your soul.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to admire Gros Piton was by taking a catamaran cruise around the island. The day-long adventure combined the thrill of being on the water with the serenity of soaking in the Pitons' beauty from every angle. These towering peaks are a photographer\u2019s dream. The scenery is genuinely some of the most beautiful I\u2019ve ever encountered.\n\nThe Thrill of the Hike\n\nOf course, no visit to Gros Piton is complete without experiencing the hike to its summit. I would say that the trail is a moderate hike, but don\u2019t let that fool you; it\u2019s a challenging adventure that rewards your perseverance with views that are nothing short of spectacular. My journey to the top remains one of my fondest memories of Saint Lucia.\n\nThe hike typically takes around two hours up and another two hours down, depending on your pace and fitness level. Good grippy shoes are a must; while I managed in running shoes, we colleagues did slip a few times along the way. The shaded trail provided relief from the tropical heat, and the railings on the steeper sections offered much-needed support, particularly on the descent.\n\nReaching the summit was exhilarating, and the panoramic views of the Caribbean Sea and the neighboring Petit Piton were worth every drop of sweat. The descent, while less physically demanding, required careful navigation to avoid slips and falls, making the railings invaluable.\n\nA Must-Do Experience\n\nFor those who prefer a less strenuous experience, Gros Piton can also be admired from various vantage points across the island. Boat rides to Soufriere or scenic drives to the nearby volcano offer excellent views of these majestic peaks. But if you\u2019re up for an adventure, the hike is an absolute must-do when in Saint Lucia.\n\nGros Piton is more than just a tourist attraction; it\u2019s a testament to the raw, untouched beauty of Saint Lucia. Each visit left me with a deeper appreciation for this majestic place, and climbing to its summit was one of the highlights of my time on the island. Whether you\u2019re an avid hiker, a photography enthusiast, or simply someone seeking a connection with nature, Gros Piton promises an experience you\u2019ll cherish forever.\n\nTips for Your Gros Piton Adventure\n\n\u2022Footwear: Invest in sturdy, grippy shoes to tackle the rocky terrain.\n\u2022Hydration: Bring plenty of water; the hike can be taxing.\n\u2022Guides: Opt for a knowledgeable guide like Simone to enhance your experience.\n\u2022Timing: Start early to avoid the midday heat and to enjoy cooler, quieter trails.\n\u2022Pace: Go at a pace that\u2019s comfortable for you; it\u2019s not a race.\n\nSaint Lucia\u2019s Gros Piton isn\u2019t just a place, it\u2019s an experience that stays with you long after you leave. For me, it was a sanctuary that offered a new thrill with every visit, and I\u2019m sure it will hold the same magic for you.",

The De\u010dani Monastery was built in the mid-14th century for the Serbian king Stefan De\u010danski and is also his mausoleum. The Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 Monastery is a group of four domed churches featuring series of wall paintings. The 13th-century frescoes of the Church of Holy Apostles are painted in a unique, monumental style. Early 14th-century frescoes in the church of the Holy Virgin of Ljevisa represent the appearance of the new so-called Palaiologian Renaissance style, combining the influences of the eastern Orthodox Byzantine and the Western Romanesque traditions. The style played a decisive role in subsequent Balkan art.</p>",

To this day facts about its origin are still not very clear, but it is supposed to have existed since Illyrian times and was a very populated area due to its richness in minerals, including gold and silver. It is a must-see site from any tourist or even local visitors.\n\nThe entire road is asphalted up to the site. During the winter when it's snowy, it is quite dangerous to drive up and down the hills to reach the castle. However, no matter the season, the panoramic views of the surrounding area are wonderful.\n\nUnfortunately, this attraction is not among the most popular ones, mostly because the institutions are not attentive enough for its significance and potential. There is no fee to visit the yards around the castle, but there is nobody waiting to show you around. Moreover, the inside is not accessible for public yet and the area close to the walls remain dangerous due to their static instability. Walls were most recently damaged by a Serbian company that was awared by UNESCO with a tender of restauration of the castle (check news between 2015 and 2020).\n\nNevertheless, take your family, friends or partner and pay it a visit. Bring snacks and drinks and enjoy a picnic during a good sunny day till the sunset.\n\nIt deserves a five-star rating because of its uniqueness, easy accessibility, potential and wonderful experience it offers. It wouldn't deserve even a 2-star rating if considering its horrible conditions :(",

    "short_description": "<p>A landscaped park of 559.9 ha astride the Neisse River and the border between Poland and Germany, it was created by Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muskau from 1815 to 1844. Blending seamlessly with the surrounding farmed landscape, the park pioneered new approaches to landscape design and influenced the development of landscape architecture in Europe and America. Designed as a &lsquo;painting with plants&rsquo;, it did not seek to evoke classical landscapes, paradise, or some lost perfection, instead using local plants to enhance the inherent qualities of the existing landscape. This integrated landscape extends into the town of Muskau with green passages that formed urban parks framing areas for development. The town thus became a design component in a utopian landscape. The site also features a reconstructed castle, bridges and an arboretum.</p>",

    "short_description": "<p>Humberstone and Santa Laura works contain over 200 former saltpeter works where workers from Chile, Peru and Bolivia lived in company towns and forged a distinctive communal pampinos culture. That culture is manifest in their rich language, creativity, and solidarity, and, above all, in their pioneering struggle for social justice, which had a profound impact on social history. Situated in the remote Pampas, one of the driest deserts on Earth, thousands of pampinos lived and worked in this hostile environment for over 60 years, from 1880, to process the largest deposit of saltpeter in the world, producing the fertilizer sodium nitrate that was to transform agricultural lands in North and South America, and in Europe, and produce great wealth for Chile. Because of the vulnerability of the structures and the impact of a recent earthquake, the site was also placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger to help mobilize resources for its conservation.</p>",

A lot of ruined houses, on a hill, and the highlight for me was the water reservoir, which is a very deep well to which you climb down using many stairs, until you reach a small cave where rainwater was collected. There is a nice activity that each visitor can participate: mud collects over the water reservoir, so the workers of the place fill buckets of this mud to remove it. Each visitor can take a bucket with him when going back up from the reservoir, helping the mud clearing effort. I really liked this game, I felt it was a great opportunity to teach my son about helping and volunteering. Overall it is very similar to tel megiddo. But tel megiddo is more interesting, which is why I gave tel hazor only a 4. It lacks a bit of development for tourists, a short video explaining about the place would be nice. Also I guess the water reservoir of tel megiddo is more impressive, withe more stairs and longer tunnels. All in all great experience for me and my 3 year old son.",

Vestiges of the Byzantine era also remain in the area, notably the foundations of the Anaktoron (Prince\u2019s Palace).

Many remains bear witness to the troubled history of Sicily, from the Byzantines to the Bourbons, interspersed with the Arabo-Muslims, the Normans, Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty (1197\u20131250), the Aragons and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Historic Syracuse offers a unique testimony to the development of Mediterranean civilization over three millennia.</p>",

At the entrance you have to leave the car (free parking, not too spacious), register your name with the ranger and take a free shuttle bus that keeps going up to the end of the road to the Necropolis North and then back to the entrance. They will pick you up on the way. So far so good. Wish someone had told me in this clarity because the map they give you is useless, but you can go either 1 km by the shuttle to the start of the walking trail and the walk a few km to the end point, or do it the other way round. From the end point you can go down the river and up the other side or simply go back. There are many signposts along the way. Unfortunately, there are no maps showing you exactly where you are. I saw some confusion along the trail. Just bring enough water when it's hot cause you walk a lot and going this and that direction adds up. As long as you end up on either end of the road, you're fine. And it's all free of charge. If organization and information was better, I would have give 5 stars. But it's Sicily after all.",

However he didn't speak any English,  we tried to communicate with the assistance of another Italian visitor who spoke English.  So the guy told us what trail to take, that it would be 2 hours hike and the spot that we would take the shuttle bus back to the entrance.  I specifically asked when this bus will pick us up and the answer was it passes all the time, every 10min. So we started the hiking, it turns out the hike was 4hours instead, with inadequate signs,no signal, and no access to any water. We passes by two museums in the area with no available  water. At last we reached the pick up point, and there was another guy there who told us the bus passes every 10min. We waited 50minutes for the bus to come pick us up, in the heat, without water.

It is an outstanding example of the company towns that were born in many remote parts of the world from the fusion of local labour and resources from an industrialized nation, to mine and process high-value natural resources. The town was built on a terrain too steep for wheeled vehicles around a large central staircase rising from the railway station. Along its route formal squares of irregular shape with ornamental trees and plants constituted the main public spaces or squares of the town. The buildings lining the streets are timber, often painted in vivid green, yellow, red and blue. At its peak Sewell numbered 15,000 inhabitants, but was largely abandoned in the 1970s.</p>",

It testifies to the golden age of early Chinese culture, crafts and sciences, a time of great prosperity of the Chinese Bronze Age. A number of royal tombs and palaces, prototypes of later Chinese architecture, have been unearthed on the site, including the Palace and Royal Ancestral Shrines Area, with more than 80 house foundations, and the only tomb of a member of the royal family of the Shang Dynasty to have remained intact, the Tomb of Fu Hao. The large number and superb craftsmanship of the burial accessories found there bear testimony to the advanced level of Shang crafts industry. Inscriptions on oracle bones found in Yin Xu bear invaluable testimony to the development of one of the world\u2019s oldest writing systems, ancient beliefs and social systems.\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3",

The principal monument of this archaeological site is the bas-relief and cuneiform inscription ordered by Darius I, The Great, when he rose to the throne of the Persian Empire, 521 BC. The bas-relief portrays Darius holding a bow, as a sign of sovereignty, and treading on the chest of a figure who lies on his back before him. According to legend, the figure represents Gaumata, the Median Magus and pretender to the throne whose assassination led to Darius\u2019s rise to power. Below and around the bas-reliefs, there are ca. 1,200 lines of inscriptions telling the story of the battles Darius waged in 521-520 BC against the governors who attempted to take apart the Empire founded by Cyrus. The inscription is written in three languages. The oldest is an Elamite text referring to legends describing the king and the rebellions. This is followed by a Babylonian version of similar legends. The last phase of the inscription is particularly important, as it is here that Darius introduced for the first time the Old Persian version of his res gestae (things done). This is the only known monumental text of the Achaemenids to document the re-establishment of the Empire by Darius I. It also bears witness to the interchange of influences in the development of monumental art and writing in the region of the Persian Empire. There are also remains from the Median period (8th to 7th centuries B.C.) as well as from the Achaemenid (6th to 4th centuries B.C.) and post-Achaemenid periods.</p>",

The symbols in the rock art, which are strongly associated with women, still have cultural relevance amongst the Chewa, & the sites are actively associated wt ceremonies and rituals.Situated within a cluster of forested granite hills & covering an area of 126.4 km2, high up the plateau of central Malawi, the 127 sites of this property feature the richest concentration of rock art in Central Africa, The rock art of the Chongoni sites records the cultural history and traditions of the peoples of the Malawi plateau: the transition from a foraging lifestyle to food production, the subsequent Ngoni invasion of the Chewa people, and the coming of the white man.",

Using gravity, water is channelled from underground sources or springs to support agriculture and domestic use. The fair and effective management and sharing of water in villages and towns is still underpinned by mutual dependence and communal values and guided by astronomical observations. Numerous watchtowers built to defend the water systems form part of the site reflecting the historic dependence of communities on the <em>aflaj</em> system.

Characteristic of the apogee of Ottoman monumental architecture and civil engineering, the bridge has 11 masonry arches with spans of 11 m to 15 m, and an access ramp at right angles with four arches on the left bank of the river. The 179.5 m long bridge is a representative masterpiece of Sinan, one of the greatest architects and engineers of the classical Ottoman period and a contemporary of the Italian Renaissance, with which his work may be compared. The unique elegance of proportion and monumental nobility of the whole site bear witness to the greatness of this style of architecture.</p>",

Today, approximately 1,800 diaolou remain standing, and mostly abandoned, in the village countryside of Kaiping.

The three forts of the town, designed by renowned Venetian engineers, were used for four centuries to defend the maritime trading interests of the Republic of Venice against the Ottoman Empire. In the course of time, the forts were repaired and partly rebuilt several times, more recently under British rule in the 19th century. The mainly neoclassical housing stock of the Old Town is partly from the Venetian period, partly of later construction, notably the 19th century. As a fortified Mediterranean port, Corfu&rsquo;s urban and port ensemble is notable for its high level of integrity and authenticity.</p>",

The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort&rsquo;s innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.</p>",

The stairs you start out on soon end, and the decline levels off into a flat, wet, and cold surface of black basalt. Within the Earth is an amazing place to be. The artificial lights are spectral, shining in pools of water gathered in the wrinkles of the hardened lava floor. There's very little to complain about here and the sights are unforgettable.

The rocks of this site are considered to be iconic for this period of the history of Earth and are the world&rsquo;s thickest and most comprehensive record of the Pennsylvanian strata (dating back 318 to 303 million years) with the most complete known fossil record of terrestrial life from that time. These include the remains and tracks of very early animals and the rainforest in which they lived, left in situ, intact and undisturbed. With its 14.7 km of sea cliffs, low bluffs, rock platforms and beach, the site groups remains of three ecosystems: estuarine bay, floodplain rainforest and fire prone forested alluvial plain with freshwater pools. It offers the richest assemblage known of the fossil life in these three ecosystems with 96 genera and 148 species of fossils and 20 footprint groups.

The tide rises quickly, so you cannot just go down the stairs to explore around the cliffs whenever you please. However, on the Joggin\u2019s website they link to the government\u2019s tide website and I wonder if you can also maybe call and ask them the day before your visit, too, if you aren\u2019t familiar with them? Once on site, they have a board that lists the tides and the safe times to be on the beach.\n\nOh, and they have a little museum there, with plenty of fossil examples, too.

    "short_description": "<p>One of the first seven villages founded by the Spaniards in Cuba, Camag&uuml;ey played a prominent role as the urban centre of an inland territory dedicated to cattle breeding and the sugar industry. Settled in its current location in 1528, the town developed on the basis of an irregular urban pattern that contains a system of large and minor squares, serpentine streets, alleys and irregular urban blocks, highly exceptional for Latin American colonial towns located in plain territories. The 54 ha Historic Centre of Camag&uuml;ey constitutes an exceptional example of a traditional urban settlement relatively isolated from main trade routes. The Spanish colonizers followed medieval European influences in terms of urban layout and traditional construction techniques brought to the Americas by their masons and construction masters. The property reflects the influence of numerous styles through the ages: neoclassical, eclectic, Art Deco, Neo-colonial as well as some Art Nouveau and rationalism.</p>",

Free from human interference, Surtsey has been producing unique long-term information on the colonisation process of new land by plant and animal life. Since they began studying the island in 1964, scientists have observed the arrival of seeds carried by ocean currents, the appearance of moulds, bacteria and fungi, followed in 1965 by the first vascular plant, of which there were 10 species by the end of the first decade. By 2004, they numbered 60 together with 75 bryophytes, 71 lichens and 24 fungi. Eighty-nine species of birds have been recorded on Surtsey, 57 of which breed elsewhere in Iceland.

    "short_description": "<p>Mantua and Sabbioneta, in the Po valley, in the north of Italy, represent two aspects of Renaissance town planning: Mantua shows the renewal and extension of an existing city, while 30 km away, Sabbioneta represents the implementation of the period&rsquo;s theories about planning the ideal city. Typically, Mantua&rsquo;s layout is irregular with regular parts showing different stages of its growth since the Roman period and includes many medieval edifices among them an 11th century rotunda and a Baroque theatre. Sabbioneta, created in the second half of the 16th century under the rule of one person, Vespasiano Gonzaga Colonna, can be described as a single-period city and has a right angle grid layout. Both cities offer exceptional testimonies to the urban, architectural and artistic realizations of the Renaissance, linked through the visions and actions of the ruling Gonzaga family. The two towns are important for the value of their architecture and for their prominent role in the dissemination of Renaissance culture. The ideals of the Renaissance, fostered by the Gonzaga family, are present in the towns&rsquo; morphology and architecture.</p>",

A new day means a new step on the smartwatch dial and a new entry on my #Instagram feed. At noon, we got ready for a trip that we haven\u2019t found time for for more than twenty years. The landscape outside the car window was similar to \u201cThe Clown\u201d by Toulouse-Lautrec. I remember the day I saw a black and white clown. I experienced cognitive dissonance. We painted a still life with a red apple and colored geometric shapes, but subconsciously they were perceived as colored. I was very touched then by that black and white clown. The artist dissected the clown's soul with a brush. Showed melancholy and sadness, excitement and anxiety. We were driving and it seemed to me that someone was drawing these two-color pictures with a simple pencil or with the help of sanguine. I wondered: \u201cDid I end up in an old Soviet TV?\u201d It was funny.\nWe drove along the grader for a long time and finally stopped to take a couple of pictures. Ducks squawked in the distance, their cackling sounds breaking the perfect silence. While we were bird watching, a truck carrying huge bales of hay passed behind us. Underfoot lay algae dried in the sun, they looked like the ashes of Vesuvius spewing lava. We drove out onto the road and drove along the rut. Grass, similar to the fur of a sage fur coat, stroked the bottom of the car. Disappointed, we were ready to head back, when suddenly Ruslan suggested we drive on. After 3 minutes we were happily running around taking pictures of the pink birds. It was an amazing feeling, as if I had graduated from school with honors again. This is probably how happy people feel. Thanks to my friends for being there, thanks to the watchman who explained the route of the trip and to the nameless dog who guards this gray landscape #birdwatching #flamingo #kazakhstan #astana #birds P.s.

The nature is beautiful and lush\n- as you go on top, it becomes somewhat of a rock climbing. Guide can be recommended as local guides will help you with the \"climbing\" part of the rocky hike to the top.\n- this climbing part of the hike was quite challenging, I'm not going to lie, even though I was very confident it will be a piece of cake\n- I recommend morning walk to the hike as the rocks can be heated up in the afternoon sun\n- after the rain, it's not recommended for this hike as the rock climbing part can be slippery\n- the view from the top is worthwhile. Absolutely incredible view of Le Morne\n- Hiking down is easier compared to climbing up, but you'll still need to use both hands, feet and sometimes your butt to sit & hike down the rocks safely.\n- we were thankful we all wore full length leggings for this hike and prepared water and some cookies to snack on at the top.\n- took us total of 3.5 hours to the top and back to the ground.\n- parking has a plenty of rooms and there is no entry fee, however you must write your names and number of members in your group and sign a safety measures before starting the hike.\n- all in all, everyone we met during the hike - including local Mauritian guides and other tourists were very helpful during this wonderful activity",

We took the horse for 170 pesos per person to go up.\nWhen arriving upstairs our guide was already there waiting for us. He truly was amazing and told us many things about the butterflies. We also had many questions and he answered everything with so much interesting information. Also he made our tour very pleasant. Gave us space when and was always ready to tell us more about the Monarca and the wildlife there.\nWe went up by horse around 1:30 pm. It takes around 20 min to get to the final stop where you have to wake through the wood by feet. The walk is easy and on the way we already saw many butterflies.\nIn general we enjoyed ourselves so much. The best time to go is when it\u2019s hot and as less as possible clouds. Because the butterflies like to be in the sun.\nWe\u2019re planning to go back next year too.

We arrived around 11am, had a quick bite before going inside. The quesadilla was delicious with a homemade blue corn tortilla. The paring attendant kept an eye on our dog inside the car. Once inside we opted to use a local guide and hike up. The hike was more of a walk, but be aware you\u2019ll be going over 10,000 feet. The air is much thinner than sea level.\n\nOur guide did a great job explaining the whole lifestyle of the monarch and did it in basic Spanish so we could understand.\n\nWe were there yesterday (2 March) and the butterflies were swarming and even mating. I\u2019d definitely recommend this place to visit. It only took us about an hour total to hike up, see the butterflies at the top and hike down.",

Archaeological excavation has revealed the landscape to be one of wetland reclamation worked almost continuously for 7,000, and possibly for 10,000 years. It contains well-preserved archaeological remains demonstrating the technological leap which transformed plant exploitation to agriculture around 6,500 years ago. It is an excellent example of transformation of agricultural practices over time, from cultivation mounds to draining the wetlands through the digging of ditches with wooden tools. Kuk is one of the few places in the world where archaeological evidence suggests independent agricultural development and changes in agricultural practice over such a long period of time.</p>",

The 61 km Bernina pass line features 13 tunnels and galleries and 52 viaducts and bridges. The property is exemplary of the use of the railway to overcome the isolation of settlements in the Central Alps early in the 20th century, with a major and lasting socio-economic impact on life in the mountains. It constitutes an outstanding technical, architectural and environmental ensemble and embodies architectural and civil engineering achievements, in harmony with the landscapes through which they pass.</p>",

Two millennia of temple building have delivered an assembly of temples that present a catalogue of the way Buddhist architecture developed and influenced palace building over a wide part of China and part of Asia. For a thousand years from the Northern Wei period (471-499) nine Emperors made 18 pilgrimages to pay tribute to the bodhisattvas, commemorated in stele and inscriptions. Started by the Emperors, the tradition of pilgrimage to the five peaks is still very much alive.

For more than one and a half millennia, Sulaiman was a beacon for travellers revered as a sacred mountain. Its five peaks and slopes contain numerous ancient places of worship and caves with petroglyphs as well as two largely reconstructed 16th century mosques. One hundred and one sites with petroglyphs representing humans and animals as well as geometrical forms have been indexed in the property so far. The site numbers 17 places of worship, which are still in use, and many that are not. Dispersed around the mountain peaks they are connected by footpaths. The cult sites are believed to provide cures for barrenness, headaches, and back pain and give the blessing of longevity. Veneration for the mountain blends pre-Islamic and Islamic beliefs. The site is believed to represent the most complete example of a sacred mountain anywhere in Central Asia, worshipped over several millennia.</p>",

Exceptionally well-preserved, the site is impressive in terms of its design and the complexity of its architectural, especially its monumental stone and earthen platform mounts and sunken circular courts. One of 18 urban settlements situated in the same area, Caral features complex and monumental architecture, including six large pyramidal structures. A quipu (the knot system used in Andean civilizations to record information) found on the site testifies to the development and complexity of Caral society. The city&rsquo;s plan and some of its components, including pyramidal structures and residence of the elite, show clear evidence of ceremonial functions, signifying a powerful religious ideology.</p>",

Built over five centuries, from 1408 to 1966, the tombs honoured the memory of ancestors, showed respect for their achievements, asserted royal authority, protected ancestral spirits from evil and provided protection from vandalism. Spots of outstanding natural beauty were chosen for the tombs which typically have their back protected by a hill as they face south toward water and, ideally, layers of mountain ridges in the distance. Alongside the burial area, the royal tombs feature a ceremonial area and an entrance. In addition to the burial mounds, associated buildings that are an integral part of the tombs include a T-shaped wooden shrine, a shed for stele, a royal kitchen and a guards&rsquo; house, a red-spiked gate and the tomb keeper&rsquo;s house. The grounds are adorned on the outside with a range of stone objects including figures of people and animals.

Immediately adjacent to the base of the Tower, is a small rectangular Roman building. The site also features a sculpture park, the Monte dos Bicos rock carvings from the Iron Age and a Muslim cemetery. The Roman foundations of the building were revealed in excavations conducted in the 1990s.

Their planning and buildings reflect watchmakers&rsquo; need of rational organization. Planned in the early 19th century, after extensive fires, the towns owed their existence to this single industry. Their layout along an open-ended scheme of parallel strips on which residential housing and workshops are intermingled reflects the needs of the local watchmaking culture that dates to the 17th century and is still alive today. The site presents outstanding examples of mono-industrial manufacturing-towns which are well preserved and still active. The urban planning of both towns has accommodated the transition from the artisanal production of a cottage industry to the more concentrated factory production of the late 19th and 20th centuries. The town of La Chaux-de-Fonds was described by Karl Marx as a &ldquo;huge factory-town&rdquo; in Das Kapital where he analyzed the division of labour in the watchmaking industry of the Jura.</p>",

The aqueduct is a pioneering masterpiece of engineering and monumental metal architecture, conceived by the celebrated civil engineer Thomas Telford. The use of both cast and wrought iron in the aqueduct enabled the construction of arches that were light and d strong, producing an overall effect that is both monumental and elegant. The property is inscribed as a masterpiece of creative genius, and as a remarkable synthesis of expertise already acquired in Europe. It is also recognized as an innovative ensemble that inspired many projects all over the world.</p>",

Following the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathar heretics (13th century) it became a powerful episcopal city. Built in a unique southern French Gothic style from local brick in characteristic red and orange colours, the lofty fortified Cathedral (late 13th century) dominates the city, demonstrating the power regained by the Roman Catholic clergy. Alongside the Cathedral is the vast bishop&rsquo;s Palais de la Berbie, overlooking the river and surrounded by residential quarters that date back to the Middle Ages. The Episcopal City of Albi forms a coherent and homogeneous ensemble of monuments and quarters that has remained largely unchanged over the centuries.</p>",

Bikini Atoll has conserved direct tangible evidence that is highly significant in conveying the power of the nuclear tests, i.e. the sunken ships sent to the bottom of the lagoon by the tests in 1946 and the gigantic Bravo crater. Equivalent to 7,000 times the force of the Hiroshima bomb, the tests had major consequences on the geology and natural environment of Bikini Atoll and on the health of those who were exposed to radiation.

This was a long-term programme that involved extending the city by draining the swampland, using a system of canals in concentric arcs and filling in the intermediate spaces. These spaces allowed the development of a homogeneous urban ensemble including gabled houses and numerous monuments. This urban extension was the largest and most homogeneous of its time. It was a model of large-scale town planning, and served as a reference throughout the world until the 19th century.</p>",

This centre of settlement, one of the oldest in Central Asia, is situated between a mountainous region suitable for cattle rearing by nomadic pastoralists, and a large valley conducive to the development of agriculture and irrigation by the first settled populations in the region. Sarazm also demonstrates the existence of commercial and cultural exchanges and trade relations with peoples over an extensive geographical area, extending from the steppes of Central Asia and Turkmenistan, to the Iranian plateau, the Indus valley and as far as the Indian Ocean.</p>",

The audio guide tour of the campus was okay, but again, it sort of repeats what is inside the museum, so of limited interest. I was told there are a few buildings I could go inside during my weekday visit, but it was pretty unclear on the ground.

Duke Arechi II (758-774) extended the walls to the\u00a0Civitas Nova, the current Triggio district. In 926 the wall was further expanded towards Porta Somma (later incorporated into the\u00a0Rocca dei Rettori) including the Tappeto district. Defense towers with a square and round plan - in the masonry of some of which we can see inserted bas-reliefs and recovered marble slabs - strengthened the walls, in which seven doors originally opened. Of these, only the Porta Arsa and the Aurea remain today, which used the arch of Trajan.\n\n\ufffc\n\nSome significant sections of the Lombard city walls remain standing, such as the one along Viale dei Rettori up to the Arch of Trajan and the one that runs along Via Torre della Catena where the tower of the same name is located and which delimits the southern border of the medieval Triggio district.\n\nPorta Arsa:\u00a0built with reused Roman materials during the reign of Arechi II, it is also called\u00a0Porta delle Limestone\u00a0due to the ancient lime kilns that were nearby, it opens on the western side of the city and consists of an arch made of limestone blocks, flanked by two half columns of the same stone.

Rich History: Fort Jesus has a storied past, having changed hands between the Portuguese, Arabs, and British over the centuries. It served as a military base, a prison, and now a museum.\n\n2. Architecture: The fort's design resembles a human figure when viewed from above, symbolizing the ideal of a \"perfect man.\" Its coral stone walls and bastions remain well-preserved.\n\n3. Museum: The museum inside the fort houses artifacts from different periods, including weapons, ceramics, and Swahili cultural items, offering insights into the region's history.\n\n4. Scenic Views: Overlooking the Indian Ocean, the fort provides stunning views of the coastline and the bustling harbour.\n\nInformative guided tours available.\n\nGreat spot for photography.\n\nTips:\n\nVisit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat.\n\nWear comfortable walking shoes.\n\nCombine the visit with other nearby attractions, such as Old Town Mombasa and Mama ngina water front.",

The dead bodies were mummified and covered with jewelry before they were laid in wooded cases to forever rest.

The guard said only guided tours are allowed, but was dismissive, vague and unhelpful about how to find a guide or buy tickets. So I looked up the tourism information centre at Town Hall, they apparently have been shuttered since 2022.\n\nFinally by reading through the Google reviews, I realised there is a guide who comes for everyone standing outside the gate every hour on the hour. There is also a small sign that sort of indicates this on the gate, which mea culpa I didn't notice at first. The tour was not in English, but the guide was very kind when I let her know I don't speak Ukranian and explained things to me separately. I was able to pay 80UAH in cash at the finish of the tour.

        "text": "Designated a World Heritage site in 2011, Ho Citadel still doesn't receive many foreign visitors. Built at the end of the 14th century, the inner walls and four main gates of the citadel are still standing. Called Th\u00e0nh Nh\u00e0 H\u1ed3 in Vietnamese, the complex is surrounded by a fertile rural landscape. The walls are overgrown with creepers and grass, but still make an impressive sight rising from the rice fields. Vietnamese farmers go about their work, both outside and inside the citadel grounds; sitting down to rest in the shade of its arched gates during the hottest part of the day. The grand royal ruins and the agricultural work going on around it, remind me of sketches by Piranesi of Rome in the 18th century, when Italy was rediscovering its past, just as Vietnam is doing today. Located near the town of V\u0129nh L\u1ed9c in Thanh H\u00f3a Province, Ho Citadel can be reached by several rural back-roads. Although the enclosure is very large (close to 1km2) it's not immediately visible, especially if you arrive at either the north, east or west gates (the south gate being the main entrance). From some positions the wall is so overgrown it's almost indistinguishable from the farmland it abuts. The main entrance (10,000vn\u0111) is through the south gate, where there are guides available and a small museum. The latter tries very hard \u2013 with English language labels and information boards \u2013 but doesn't amount to much more that bits and pieces of pottery, cannonballs, bricks and tiles. The other gates also have small ticket offices, but most of the ticket inspectors seem to be either asleep or drunk and drowsy. If you avoid weekends and public holidays chances are you'll have the whole citadel to yourself, making you feel as though you're the first foreigner to have stumbled upon these imperial ruins.",

They record the early establishment of a complex marine ecosystem. The site documents at least sixteen phyla and a variety of enigmatic groups as well as about 196 species, presenting exceptional testimony to the rapid diversification of life on Earth 530&nbsp;million years ago, when almost all of today&rsquo;s major animal groups emerged. It opens a palaeobiological window of great significance to scholarship.</p>",

There is at this place a very fine marble palace, the rooms of which are all gilt and painted with figures of men and beasts and birds, and with a variety of trees and flowers, all executed with such exquisite art that you regard them with delight and astonishment.\n\nRound this Palace a wall is built, inclosing a compass of 16 miles, and inside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks, and beautiful meadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as are of ferocious nature), which the Emperor has procured and placed there to supply food for his gerfalcons and hawks, which he keeps there in mew.[5] Of these there are more than 200 gerfalcons alone, without reckoning the other hawks. The Khan himself goes every week to see his birds sitting in mew, and sometimes he rides through the park with a leopard behind him on his horse's croup; and then if he sees any animal that takes his fancy, he slips his leopard at it, and the game when taken is made over to feed the hawks in mew. This he does for diversion.\n\nMoreover at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood he has another Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description. It is gilt all over, and most elaborately finished inside. It is stayed on gilt and lacquered columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to support the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes, covered with a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will rot them. These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and from 10 to 15 paces in length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are split so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house is roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent the wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these canes, which I may mention serve also for a great variety of other useful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken down and put up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200 cords of silk.",

The temples are the focus of a cooperative water management system of canals and weirs, known as <em>subak,</em> that dates back to the 9th century. Included in the landscape is the 18th-century Royal Water Temple of Pura Taman Ayun, the largest and most impressive architectural edifice of its type on the island. The <em>subak</em> reflects the philosophical concept of <em>Tri Hita Karana</em>, which brings together the realms of the spirit, the human world and nature. This philosophy was born of the cultural exchange between Bali and India over the past 2,000 years and has shaped the landscape of Bali. The <em>subak </em>system of democratic and egalitarian farming practices has enabled the Balinese to become the most prolific rice growers in the archipelago despite the challenge of supporting a dense population.</p>",

The pillars form rocky buttresses isolated from each other by deep and steep gullies developed by frost shattering directed along intervening joints. Penetration of water from the surface has facilitated cryogenic processes (freeze-thaw action), which have widened gullies between pillars leading to their isolation. Fluvial processes are also critical to the pillars. The site also contains a wealth of Cambrian fossil remains of numerous species, some of them unique.</p>",

The inhabitants worship the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, forests and other natural phenomena including fire. They live in 82 villages situated between the mountaintop forests and the terraces.

Beyond this, channels and waterways wind across the axis, feeding a series of dramatic waterfalls and wild rapids, the geyser-like Grand Fountain which leaps 50m high, the lake and secluded ponds that enliven the Romantic garden created in the 18th century by Carl&rsquo;s great-grandson, Elector Wilhelm I.

The ecclectic architecture of the forts, some up to 20 kilometres in circumference, bears testimony to the power of the Rajput princely states that flourished in the region from the 8th to the 18th centuries. Enclosed within defensive walls are major urban centres, palaces, trading centres and other buildings including temples that often predate the fortifications within which developed an elaborate courtly culture that supported learning, music and the arts. Some of the urban centres enclosed in the fortifications have survived, as have many of the site's temples and other sacred buildings. The forts use the natural defenses offered by the landscape: hills, deserts, rivers, and dense forests. They also feature extensive water harvesting structures, largely still in use today.</p>",

A sprawling oasis of tranquility, it boasts well-manicured lawns, vibrant flower beds, and a diverse array of trees providing ample shade. The winding pathways invite visitors on a delightful journey, revealing hidden nooks and scenic spots.\n\nThe park caters to various interests with its sports facilities, including basketball courts and a jogging track. Families can relish quality time in the designated play areas, while fitness enthusiasts appreciate the well-equipped outdoor gym. A centrally located pond adds charm, hosting ducks and swans that captivate both young and old.\n\nHowever, the park's popularity can lead to crowded weekends, impacting the serene atmosphere. Additionally, limited seating areas near key attractions may pose challenges during peak hours. Though maintenance is generally commendable, occasional litter can detract from the overall appeal.\n\nWhile the park offers an escape from urban hustle, enhancing visitor amenities such as more benches, additional restroom facilities, and periodic litter patrols could elevate the experience. Despite these considerations, this green retreat remains a cherished destination, providing a refreshing blend of nature and recreation for the community.",

        "text": "Tajik National Park (Mountains of the Pamirs)\nTajikistan National Park covers more than 2.5 million hectares in the east of the country, at the centre of the so-called \u201cPamir Knot\u201d, a meeting point of the highest mountain ranges on the Eurasian continent. It consists of high plateaux in the east and, to the west, rugged peaks, some of them over 7,000 meters high, and features extreme seasonal variations of temperature. The longest valley glacier outside the Polar region is located among the 1,085 glaciers inventoried in the site, which also numbers 170 rivers and more than 400 lakes. Rich flora species of both the south-western and central Asian floristic regions grow in the Park which shelters nationally rare and threatened birds and mammals (Marco Polo Argali sheep, Snow Leopards and Siberian Ibex and more). Subject to frequent strong earthquakes, the Park is sparsely inhabited, and virtually unaffected by agriculture and permanent human settlements. It offers a unique opportunity for the study of plate tectonics and subduction phenomena.\nTajik National Park (2,611,674 ha in area) encompasses almost the entire Pamir Mountains, the third highest mountain ecosystem in the world after the Himalaya and Karakorum Mountains. The Pamir Mountains lie at the centre of the \u2018Pamir Knot\u2019, the term used by geographers to describe the tangle of the highest mountain ranges on the Eurasian continent. Huge tectonic forces stemming from the collision of the Indian-Australian plate with the Eurasian Plate have progressively thrown up the Himalaya, Karakoram, Hindu Kush, Kunlun and Tien Shan \u2013 all radiating out from the Pamir Mountains. Along with the Karakoram Mountains, the Pamir region is one of the most tectonically-active locations in the world.\n\nTajik National Park stands out as a very large protected area, with a stark treeless landscape of exceptional natural beauty. The outstanding scenic values are enhanced by the landform juxtaposition of heavily-glaciated high peaks and high plateaux with an alpine desert character. The property contains a number of superlative natural phenomena, including: Fedchenko Glacier (the longest glacier in the world outside of the Polar Regions); Lake Sarez (a very high, deep lake impounded just over a century ago by a severe earthquake which generated a huge landslide forming the Uzoi Dam, the highest natural dam in the world); and Karakul Lake, likely to be the world\u2019s highest large lake of meteoric origin.\nTajik National Park is one of the largest high mountain protected areas in the Palearctic Realm. The Fedchenko Glacier, the largest valley glacier of the Eurasian Continent and the world\u2019s longest outside of the Polar Regions, is unique and a spectacular example at the global level. The visual combination of some of the deepest gorges in the world, surrounded by rugged glaciated peaks, as well as the alpine desert and lakes of the Pamir high plateaux adds up to an alpine wilderness of exceptional natural beauty. Lake Sarez and Lake Karakul are superlative natural phenomena. Lake Sarez, impounded behind the highest natural dam in the world, is of great geomorphic interest. Lake Karakul is likely to be the highest large lake of meteoric origin.\nThe Pamir Mountains are a major centre of glaciation on the Eurasian continent and Tajik National Park illustrates within one protected area an outstanding juxtaposition of many high mountains, valley glaciers, and deep river gorges alongside the cold continental desert environment of the high Pamir Plateau landforms. An outstanding landform feature of the property\u2019s geologically dynamic terrain is Lake Sarez..",

It encompasses six component sites with urban remains and agricultural lands divided into several hundreds of chora, rectangular plots of equal size.

The site features several public building complexes and residential neighbourhoods, as well as early Christian monuments alongside remains from Stone and Bronze Age settlements; Roman and medieval tower fortifications and water supply systems; and exceptionally well-preserved examples of vineyard planting and dividing walls. In the 3rd century AD, the site was known as the most productive wine centre of the Black Sea and remained a hub of exchange between the Greek, Roman and Byzantine Empires and populations north of the Black Sea. It is an outstanding example of democratic land organization linked to an ancient polis, reflecting the city&rsquo;s social organization.</p>",

The cave was closed off by a rock fall approximately 20,000 years BP and remained sealed until its discovery in 1994, which helped to keep it in pristine condition. Over 1,000 images have so far been inventoried on its walls, combining a variety of anthropomorphic and animal motifs. Of exceptional aesthetic quality, they demonstrate a range of techniques including the skilful use of shading, combinations of paint and engraving, anatomical precision, three-dimensionality and movement. They include several dangerous animal species difficult to observe at that time, such as mammoth, bear, cave lion, rhino, bison and auroch, as well as 4,000 inventoried remains of prehistoric fauna and a variety of human footprints.</p>",

Because I have also seen real stalactites in other tourist destinations.\nMaybe for some others, they will feel bored to spend 18\u20ac to see a copy product, but I think it is worth it because of the dedication of the whole team. I went with my family and my neice, although she is only 3 years old, she still likes it and is curious to know.\nThe places around the cave are how we learn more about human history and how we evolved through images, touch, and sound.

The church is also currently the parish church of a Catholic community of the local pastoral association.\nThe westwork was built in the 9th century and is the only part of the old church that remains. Hardly any Carolingian architecture has survived the test of time. This makes it unique and so culturally and historically valuable. Fragments of old original paintings can still be discovered inside. Stylistically, the Westwerk is rather simple, but beautiful and impressive.\nThe rest of the church dates from the 17th century and is a baroque building that is well worth seeing. The baroque part has rich artistic furnishings and is also worth seeing.\nWith a general admission ticket you can also visit the neighboring castle.\nThe castle and gardens are also worth seeing. It was originally a Benedictine monastery, which was one of the most important in Northern Europe in the 9th and 10th centuries. The monastery was rebuilt in the Baroque style in the 17th century. Then it briefly became a prince-bishopric and, from 1820, finally a private aristocratic residence.\nThe buildings, rooms and royal library are impressive.\nA visit is worth it.

Rani-ki-Vav was built at the height of craftsmens\u2019 ability in stepwell construction and the Maru-Gurjara architectural style, reflecting mastery of this complex technique and great beauty of detail and proportions. Designed as an inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water, it is divided into seven levels of stairs with sculptural panels of high artistic quality; more than 500 principle sculptures and over a thousand minor ones combine religious, mythological and secular imagery, often referencing literary works. The fourth level is the deepest and leads into a rectangular tank 9.5\u00a0m by 9.4\u00a0m, at a depth of 23\u00a0m.

The depth of the stepwell and its symmetrical design are remarkable, showcasing the advanced craftsmanship of that era.\n\nOne fascinating fact is that Rani Ki Vav is featured on the Indian \u20b9100 note, which speaks volumes about its cultural and historical significance. Seeing the real site after recognizing it from the currency makes the experience even more special!\n\nAnother great thing is that entry is completely free, making it accessible to all.

The remains of the mudbrick city represent the emergence of the first complex societies in eastern Iran. Founded around 3200\u00a0BC, it was populated during four main periods up to 1800\u00a0BC, during which time there developed several distinct areas within the city: those where monuments were built, and separate quarters for housing, burial and manufacture. Diversions in water courses and climate change led to the eventual abandonment of the city in the early second millennium. The structures, burial grounds and large number of significant artefacts unearthed there, and their well-preserved state due to the dry desert climate, make this site a rich source of information regarding the emergence of complex societies and contacts between them in the third millennium BC.</p>",

Its earliest remains date from the 7th century, but it was rebuilt several times, notably in the early 17th century in anticipation of an attack from the Sino-Manchu Qing dynasty. The city embodies a synthesis of the defensive military engineering concepts of the period, based on Chinese and Japanese influences, and changes in the art of fortification following the introduction from the West of weapons using gunpowder. A city that has always been inhabited, and which was the provincial capital over a long period, it contains evidence of a variety of military, civil and religious buildings and has become a symbol of Korean sovereignty.</p>",

Of the numerous sightseeing in Jeddah, the Makkah Gate is one of the most prominent. Jeddah sightseeing will never be completed without visiting the fabulous Makkah Gate.\nDuring 100 AD Jeddah was fortified by limestone coral walls. During the 16th century, people constructed 6 watchtowers and gates. The people constructed them to defend against the Portuguese attack. Of the 6 gates, Bab Makkah was the eastern gate and Bab Al Magharibah the western one.\nThe gate Bab Sharif was south facing. The other gates Bab Al Bunt, Bab Sharaf, and Bab Al Madinah were north facing. The Makkah Gate in Jeddah is one of the three reconstructed gates. The Makkah Gate in Jeddah is located in the Downtown of Jeddah. Numerous pilgrims frequently come to the city of Jeddah and also go from the city of Jeddah.\nThe Makkah Gate at Jeddah provides the getaway to this wide gamut of pilgrims. Near the gate, the locals offer fine hospitality to the pilgrims and tourists. The caravanserais are present there to make life easier for the visitors. The architectural brilliance of the gate is worth going through. The Turkish influence is largely evident in the construction of Makkah Gate at Jeddah.

There will be a guy with a megaphone grouping people according to what path you want to take. We chose option 3 and it was beautiful. There were three caves and three temples. There are restrooms at the temples so feel free to grab a coffee beforehand. Remember your boat number before you get off. Each cave is shorter than the previous and get ready to duck FYI they force you to pass through a bunch of stalls selling merchandise.

This sprawling area in Ninh B\u00ecnh province seamlessly blends breathtaking natural beauty with rich cultural and historical significance, making it a must-visit destination for anyone exploring northern Vietnam.\n\nThe journey through Tr\u00e0ng An begins with a tranquil boat ride along a winding river surrounded by towering limestone karsts, lush greenery, and crystal-clear waters. The scenery is absolutely mesmerizing, with each turn revealing new perspectives of the dramatic landscape. The boat ride takes you through a series of caves and grottoes, each with its own unique formations and charm.\n\nBefore heading to Tr\u00e0ng An, we enjoyed bicycling around the nearby countryside, an activity suggested by our tour guide. This was an excellent way to experience the peaceful rural surroundings, with rice paddies, small villages, and quiet paths that offered a glimpse of daily life in Vietnam. It added an adventurous and intimate touch to the day, and we highly recommend it to anyone planning a visit.\n\nThe boat ride itself was an unforgettable experience. The fascinating part was that the boats were rowed by local women, who impressively maneuvered through narrow waterways and caves with great skill and grace. Watching them row with such expertise was truly inspiring and added a special cultural aspect to the experience.\nThe skillful rowers, often locals from nearby villages, guided us through narrow passages and shared fascinating stories about the area\u2019s history and legends.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the weather in September was quite hot, and the sunshine was strong throughout the day. While the landscape was beautiful, the heat made the experience a bit exhausting. If you\u2019re planning a visit, we recommend choosing a cooler time of year, like early spring or late autumn, to fully enjoy the journey.",

The property bears clear testimony to the development of a very specialized artisan activity that has become an agro-industrial enterprise.</span></p>",

From the moment you enter inside, you are enchanted by the pulsating glimmer from all the gold mosaics that are embedded all through out the inner walls. The walls and columns are richly decorated and portray various stories from the Bible. People back then could not read and there was more than two languages spoken in the area so pictures was the solution to spreading the scripture to the masses.

You can get a full understanding of the site and its history.\nWhen you reach to the site you have to remove your shoes and access to the site with socks.

The paintings lie on the western bank of the Ming River (Chinese: \u660e\u6c5f; pinyin: M\u00edng Ji\u0101ng; literally: \"Bright River\") which is a tributary of the Ta River. The natural area around this cultural landscape belongs to the Nature Reserve, Ai Diem town, Ninh Minh district. On July 15, 2016, Ta Giang Hoa Son Stone Art Cultural Landscape was recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe paintings are believed to be around 1,800-2,500[2] or 1,600-2,400 years old. The period when the paintings were painted was probably from the Warring States period to the end of the Han Dynasty in Chinese history. The paintings are believed to be works of art by the ancient Lac Viet people, ancestors of today's Zhuang people. Carbon dating shows that the oldest painting was painted 16,000 years ago, while the latest painting is 690 years old.\n\nThe mountain's main cliffs are 170 meters wide and 40 meters high and are said to be the largest rock paintings in China. The painting is located at an altitude of 30 to 90 meters above river level with about 1,900 discrete images arranged in 110 image groups. The materials used for drawing are Hematite, animal glue and blood, creating a characteristic red color for the drawings. Depicted images include bronze drums, knives, swords, bells, and boats. Some images of humans are 60 cm tall, 150 cm tall, and some even reach 3 meters tall.",

Located near modern-day Kavala, Philippi was an important city in antiquity, named after King Philip II of Macedon in 356 BC. Its strategic position on the Via Egnatia made it a crucial cultural and military hub throughout the Hellenistic, Roman, and early Christian eras.\n\nOne of the site\u2019s most notable features is its well-preserved Roman forum, which served as the city\u2019s political and commercial center. Visitors can also explore the ruins of the ancient theater, originally built in the 4th century BC and later adapted for Roman gladiatorial games. The theater is still used for performances today, making it a vibrant link between past and present.\n\nPhilippi holds immense significance for Christianity, as it was here that the Apostle Paul founded the first Christian church in Europe around 49 AD. The site includes the remains of early Christian basilicas and the prison where Paul and Silas were imprisoned, as described in the Acts of the Apostles. These religious landmarks add to the spiritual resonance of the site.\n\nRecognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Philippi offers a fascinating mix of archaeological treasures that reflect the city\u2019s diverse history. From its ancient ruins to its Christian heritage, the Archaeological Site of Philippi is a must-visit for history enthusiasts and pilgrims alike.",

It soured the whole experience.\nAfter the first fee, I drove down the road and missed the side track to the ruins - on the way back I saw the broken sign on the ground. This side track is in very bad condition and my vehicle almost could not make it back up. I parked near the end & couldn't find the way to the ruins and there was no-one around to ask. I spent 10 minutes looking before someone appeared from the house to insist on me paying another $3, (and they didn't have any change).\nYou have to walk past the green toilet block, under the awning and past the green house and then turn left to get to the path.\nThe path is mostly loose, sharp and slippery rocks. There are some precarious small bridges and you also have to wade through\nchannels at different points. It's up to mid-thigh deep at some points even around low tide. Plus some parts were like quicksand and you sink into the mud and sand.\nThe ruins are just that - they are very ruined. All you see are paths and walls. If you've never seen a stone age site before, the walls are impressive. No doubt there were structures for different purposes but there is no signage or explanations. The $25 preservation fee is a joke, as nothing is being done. In fact the whole site is being reclaimed by the sea and with rising sea levels this will continue.\nI don't really think it's worthwhile driving 1 hour20 from Kolonia to visit this site, especially given the excessive fees.",

ON arrival, very little more was to be found beyond \"we could take you by boat\". Luckily a friend who had been in Ponhpei for 5 weeks had done the walk in and gave us the run down. Finding the place by yourself is a bit of an adventure LOL. We rented a car to drive aorund the island and vivist he ruins.\nThe ruins are well worth the time to visit. They are amazing. Think Tikal, Copan Ruinas or Machu Pichu in the Americas, but on the ocean in Oceania. Truly amazing structure and construction for the age and the mystery surrounding them adds to the mystique.\nIt is very obvous that UNESCO and Aid Organisations came in and did the 'Star Trek' \"we'll huild you a visistor centre, and paths and 'imporove the site'. They came they huilt, they did the openning ceremony and took the photos, and left it in their wake. Obviously nothing has been done to the site or amentities since they walked away. You can see the run down toilets, the closed and decaying visirtor centre and log bridges that used to be between the islands. Some local tour guides are trying to keep the most imporant ones nailed together, but this site is disappearing again under the jungle.\nRecommend you plan to spend and hour or two wandering around is plenty of time for most people. We did the drive down from Kolonia in about an 1hr and 20mins down east coast, spent 2 hours, then drove back up the west coast in just over an hour.\nCouple of things:\n1. The site is no longer maintined by anyone, it is very obvious. Some of the bridges have been makeshift repaired, we reckon by tour guides who need to keep the way open for their business.\n2. Wear sturdy footwear. I only wore my wetsuit boots from diving thinking we'd be a lot more in the water. The paths are made of coral, and the soles weren't thick enough. Chacos or Tevas recommended.\n3. When making the crossing to the main island, a guide warned us to shuffle our feet especially at low tide as stingrays do come along the canals to feed.\n4. You want to be reasonably fit to do the walk in along the path that has not been well kept, and it's a bit of a hike in and out on a rough, unkept path",

There are many things that are still yet to be uncovered but it was awesome to see.\n\nWe started by taking and right and heading around that way. It just keeps getting better as you go. Even if there are a ton of people at the entrance, you will not be rubbing shoulders with anyone as you have plenty of space to walk and see things privately.\n\nWhen we arrived, there were archeologists uncovering an old bazaar! How neat! There were some further excavations going on in some of the churches. These were so beautiful and filled with paintings of varying saints that you can still see. One thing that is very disappointing is that all the churches have people\u2019s names etched in them or general graffiti. The mosques seem to be taken care of a bit more which is a relief! We would hate to see these places destroyed, too.\n\nLastly, You can also see Armenia and the beautiful river that divides the two countries. It is absolutely amazing!",

You can start left or right as it brings you back to the starting point (parking station or bus stop). I give it a 4 star because there is only one bus departure and one arrival with lots of resting time between them. BUS leaves from Esquel at 7h45 mon-fri and 8am on Sat-sun. Careful as the bus driver doubles the price for tourists (not all). See if you can ask a local to buy you the departure and arrival ticket. It costs normally 800 soles (both ways) but expect to pay 1600 as I did. It leaves around 4h45 or 5h15 pm but better go at 4h45 to be safe as there are no other busses.  You can complete everything in 2-3hrs at the green lake but you can't walk to the other lake as it is too far.  If you manage to get a lift from drivers you can go to the other lakes but see the bus schedule attached (it will leave at different times because it is a long road). Ask the driver for the different times. If you are lucky to manage a ride you have sufficient time for 2 main lakes. The 3rd trail is found near the parking lot (ask the parking lot agent for that trail starting point). Aside from the price discrimination,  the good news that there are no entrance fee for the park, maybe due to covid. Total cost as of oct 2022 is either 800 or 1600 pesos. Bring food and water.",

The property comprises more than a hundred temples, ten of which are octagonal, unique specimens of their genre in South-East Asia. Decorated sandstone elements in the site are characteristic of the pre-Angkor decorative idiom, known as the Sambor Prei Kuk Style. Some of these elements, including lintels, pediments and colonnades, are true masterpieces. The art and architecture developed here became models for other parts of the region and lay the ground for the unique Khmer style of the Angkor period.</p>",

There is a mixture of different architectural styles including Traditional Southern Fujian Style, Western Classical Revival Style and Veranda Colonial Style.

        "text": "Ahmedabad (Gujarati: \u0a85\u0aae\u0aa6\u0abe\u0ab5\u0abe\u0aa6 Amd\u0101v\u0101d) is the seventh largest city in India with a population of 8.5 million. Although it is the commercial hub of one of the most prosperous states of India, Gujarat, it's not the state capital, which is its twin city of Gandhinagar, 30 km (19 mi) to the north.\n\nAhmedabad is a good example of contrast between the materialistic attitude and the spirituality of self-renunciation. One of the fastest growing cities in India, Ahmedabad is a centre for information technology, education and industries. Bhadra Fort, Shaking Minarets and Tran Darwaja are the foremost historical sites of the city. Kankaria Lake and Vastrapur Lake are places which let you feel the pleasure of nature. If you want to enjoy the colourful side of this area, then pay a visit during the major festivals of Ahmedabad: Uttarayan and Navratri are two festivals that are celebrated with great zeal and gusto. Winter is considered the best time to visit the city.\n\nA rapidly growing metropolis, an industrial hub, an educational hotspot, and a city with a magnificent past \u2013 Ahmedabad is one of the most important cities in Gujarat. Located on the banks of the Sabarmati River, Ahmedabad is the former capital of Gujarat, and its delicious food, colourful culture is making it a fast-growing tourist destination. The historic city of Ahmedabad or the old part of the city was declared as the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nSabarmati Ashram, situated directly beside the Sabarmati river, is a quaint and peaceful ashram built by Mahatma Gandhi after he returned from South Africa. To this date, Gandhiji\u2019s living quarters are preserved here and is now used as a museum where visitors can learn all about his life and his teachings. The infamous Dandi Salt March, which was a crucial point in India\u2019s independence struggle, originated from this ashra\n\nThe Gujarati community is known for its hospitality and for being shrewd businessmen. Ahmedabad is a big industrial city long reputed for its textile industry, and today more so for its chemical, petroleum, international trade & IT industries. It is also known for its financial services industry, and as the modern hub of the Jain Religion. The city has institutions such as the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad, National Institute of Design, Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU), Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information & Communication Technology, IHM, MICA, EDI, Nirma University, Swaminarayan Gurukul, CEPT (Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology) University and NIFT.\n\nAhmedabad is well known for its textile industries. Be sure to look for the traditional hand embroidered and tie & dye clothes, and if you are buying from the roadside shops be prepared to haggle. It would not be advisable to try these without a local guide. The city's main market area is situated at Thron Darwaja, Dhalgarwad, Ratan Pole, Manek Chowk (old areas) near Lal Darwaja and newer markets like C.G.Road and Sarkhej - Gandhinagar highway near Vastrapur. It is generally a crowded area, but you get a better variety of clothes, though it is very crowded during festival seasons. The street side shops near Law Garden also offers good choices. Some shops such as Bandhej and Sanskruti offer these traditional items at fixed (and maybe overpriced) rates. But now the big shopping malls are offering almost all the things at a very cheap rate.\n\nAhmadabad\u2019s dynastic history has made it a meeting place of the Hindu, Muslim, and Jaina architectural traditions. A\u1e25mad Shah and his successors ordered the dismantling and adaptation of Hindu temples in order to build mosques. This gave many of Ahmadabad\u2019s mosques and tombs a Hindu flavur in their form and decoration. The dense \u201cforest\u201d of 260 richly carved columns within the J\u0101mi\u02bf Masjid (Great Mosque), which was completed in 1423, recalls the hall of a Hindu temple. At the mosque\u2019s entrance is the domed tomb of A\u1e25mad Shah (1441), and on the road leading to it is the Tin Darwaza (c. 1425), a triumphal triple-arch gateway through which the sultan was borne to worship.",

This place became a site of pilgrimage for the three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The town was sited at the crossroads of trade routes for caravans travelling between southern Palestine, Sinai, Eastern Jordan and the north of the Arabian Peninsula. Although the subsequent Ottoman Period (1517-1917) heralded an extension of the town to the surrounding areas and brought numerous architectural additions, particularly the raising of the roof level of houses to provide more upper stories, the overall Mamluk morphology of the town is seen to have persisted with its hierarchy of areas, quarters based on ethnic, religious or professional groupings, and houses with groups of rooms organized according to a tree-shaped system.</p>",

Named as a Unesco's World Natural and Cultural Heritage Site in 2018, the mountain is home to a conservation area, a nature reserve, and a number of Buddhist temples\u2014it has been considered a sacred site for centuries.\n\nFanjingshan Temple is actually the 2 next-door temples, namely Temple of the Buddha (\u91ca\u8fe6\u6bbf) & Maitreya Temple (\u5f25\u52d2\u6bbf), on the peak of the Red Clouds Golden Summit, which rises more than 330 feet (100.6 meters) above the surrounding mountaintop. One is for worshipping Sakiymuni representing the present and the other is for Maitreya representing the future.\n\nThe 2 temples were originally built about over 500 years ago in Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and the present temples have been rebuilt in Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) according to its original look, and more new temples also were built along the mountain way to \u201cRed Clouds Golden Summit\u201d, including Cheng\u2019en Temple, Baoguo Temple, Longquan Temple, etc.\n\nThere is only one hall for each temple, which is built with layers of stone pieces into 17.7 feet (5.4 meters) wide and 18.2 feet (5.55 meters) deep. There is a short stonebridge linking between the two temples above the deep Gold Sword Gorge.\n\nFanjingshan is an important landmark for Buddhists as they believe it's where the Maitreya Buddha found \"enlightenment\".\n\nIn 2019, National Geographic Traveler put Fanjingshan on its \"Best Trips of the Year\" list and described hiking up the mountain as \"climbing through a sea of clouds\".\n\nTo reach the temples, visitors must climb 8,888 narrow steps (with iron chains at one side, for holding) from the foot to the summit, which takes around less than 2 hours (needs much energy and not recommended for people with not-so-good physical condition or suffer acrophobia), though there is the option to ride a cable car part way up the side of the ridge.\n\nBecause Fanjingshan remained relatively isolated for so many years, it has an astonishing amount of biodiversity. With altitudes ranging from 1,640 feet (500 meters) to 8,432 feet (2,570 meters) above sea level, it's home to over 2,000 endemic plant species (31 of which are endangered) and hundreds of endangered or/and threatened animals, including Grey snub-nosed monkey, Chinese giant salamander, Forest musk deer and Reeve\u2019s pheasant... In fact, some species date to the Tertiary period\u2014between 66 million and 2 million years ago.\n\nTo see Fanjingshan Temple, visitors need to get to Tongren City first and transfer to Fanjingshan by taxi or local bus.\n\nTongren Fenghuang Airport has flights to/from Beijing (2.5 hours), Shanghai (2.5 hours), Guiyang (1 hour), Guilin (1 hour), Kunming (2 hours), Hangzhou (2.5 hours), Guangzhou (1.5 hour), Shenzhen (1.5 hour), Xiamen (2 hours), etc. Besides, Tongren South Railway Station is linked by bullet trains with Guiyang (2 hours), Chengdu (5 hours), Chongqing (4 hours), Guangzhou (6 hours), Kaili (1 hour), Changsha (3.5 hours), etc.\n\nFrom Tongren, visitors can take a local taxi to Fanjingshan for about 1.5 hour. Besides, some direct buses are available from both airport and railway station to Fanjingshan.\n\nEntry to this site costs 110 yuan for adults ($17). The 3,400-metre cable car ride costs 90 yuan ($14) for a return journey (half an hour each way). Whatever season you visit, the advice is to pack some warm clothes and waterproofs.\n\n* Photos courtesy of Internet and Facebook. Thanks!",

For centuries, it has been revered as a holy place, particularly by Buddhists who believe it to be the site of the Maitreya Buddha's enlightenment.\nOriginally constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the Fanjingshan Temple complex underwent reconstruction in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). The complex comprises two main temples: the Temple of the Buddha, dedicated to Sakyamuni, and the Maitreya Temple, honoring the future Buddha. These temples, perched atop the Red Clouds Golden Summit, are connected by a stone bridge spanning the Gold Sword Gorge.\nReaching the summit requires a challenging ascent of 8,888 steps or a less strenuous cable car ride. The journey rewards visitors with breathtaking views and a glimpse into the mountain's rich history and spiritual significance.\nFanjingshan's isolation and diverse altitudes have fostered a unique ecosystem. The mountain is home to over 2,000 plant species, many of which are endemic or endangered. Additionally, it provides a habitat for various threatened animals, including the grey snub-nosed monkey and the Chinese giant salamander. Some of these species have origins dating back to the Tertiary period.\nTo reach Fanjingshan, visitors typically travel to Tongren City. The city is accessible by air via Tongren Fenghuang Airport or by rail through Tongren South Railway Station.

    "short_description": "<p>Chiribiquete National Park, the largest protected area in Colombia, is the confluence point of four biogeographical provinces: Orinoquia, Guyana, Amazonia, and North Andes. As such, the National Park guarantees the connectivity and preservation of the biodiversity of these provinces, constituting itself as an interaction scenario in which flora and fauna diversity and endemism have flourished. One of the defining features of Chiribiquete is the presence of tepuis (table-top mountains), sheer-sided sandstone plateaux that outstand in the forest and result in dramatic scenery that is reinforced by its remoteness, inaccessibility and exceptional conservation. Over 75,000 figures have been made by indigenous people on the walls of the 60 rock shelters from 20,000 BCE, and are still made nowadays by the uncontacted peoples protected by the National Park. These paintings depict hunting scenes, battles, dances and ceremonies, as well as fauna and flora species, with a particular the worship of the jaguar, a symbol of power and fertility. The indigenous communities, which are not directly present on the site, consider Chiribiquete as a sacred place that cannot be visited and that should be preserved unaltered.</p>",

Each has cattle bomas and multiple gates except Kakuku to the West that has only one gate.\nThe museum has also constructed a typical Luo homestead of a polygamist. Which is the huts seen in entry.\nThey also have a Luo traditional granary for storing grains or cereals.\nThere's a multipurpose Hall on the grounds as well.\nThe plans are underway to construct a resource center and a hotel on the facility. This is a report we got from the curator on the 7th of October 2019.\nThe other Wonderful features of the museum is the 800 metres nature trail. It affords wonderful fauna and flora as the habit is so virgin and serene. There is a troop or two of velvet monkeys jumping from tree to tree.\nBird watchers would not be disappointed either for there are hundreds of different species of birds. In the morning they wake up their guests with sweet melodies of chirping and singing from their rich repertoire.\nFrom my visit earlier in the year I noticed a number of improvement as they have recently put up a toilet block with modern toilets.\nThe grounds have very lush lawns and would be a perfect place to shoot a wedding photo session for the locals. It would be worthy effort to short an epic documentary as well.\nThe major disappointment is the poor state of the road to Thimlich Ohinga, Archaeological site. The government need to improve the quality of the road if any and many could be encouraged to visit such a museum.\nFrom here to lake Victoria is 25 kilometers only.",

They are just a few of the countless pillars that made up the settlement of G\u00f6bekli Tepe, on the border between Turkey and Syria. The civilization that built this and similar settlements still has no name. In fact, until recently their existence was completely unknown.\n...\nWe do know a few things about them, however. They did not practice agriculture, since all the seeds found within G\u00f6bekli Tepe are wild, and not cultivated. Nor did they practice animal husbandry, since the very large number of meat remains found (it seems that they had huge feasts) are all from game, and not from farm animals. Moreover, the stylized statues in the center of the stone circles wear loincloths. This means that it must not have been cold at the time of G\u00f6bekli Tepe's construction. All these elements suggest that the original settlement may probably be much older than it appears. Perhaps even thousands of years older.\n...\nIt is not a burial site, since not a single corpse has been found inside. It is not a shrine, since the depiction of even one god or deity does not appear. It does not appear to have been a town or village, since it seems to lack an appropriate water source to quench the thirst of a substantial group of people. What is it then? All over the walls of G\u00f6bekli Tepe are engraved hundreds of \u201csnakes\u201d descending from 'above, from the sky. Heavenly beings appear from which these \u201csnakes\u201d emerge. According to astronomers, about 12,000 years ago a swarm of asteroids or comets heavily bombarded the Earth, destroying entire territories on 4 continents. It was a momentous devastation. Most likely, G\u00f6bekli Tepe is a \u201cmemorial\u201d to the time when \u201cfiery serpents,\u201d or comet fragments raining down from above, destroyed the world.\n...\nBut if G\u00f6bekli Tepe is a memorial to the cataclysm that struck us some 12,800 years ago, where are the cities of the builders? What customs did they have? More importantly, where did they come from?",

The Budj Bim lava flows provide the basis for the complex system of channels, weirs and dams developed by the Gunditjmara in order to trap, store and harvest kooyang (short-finned eel \u2013 <em>Anguilla australis</em>). The highly productive aquaculture system provided an economic and social base for Gunditjmara society for six millennia. The Budj Bim Cultural Landscape is the result of a creational process narrated by the Gunditjmara as a deep time story, referring to the idea that they have always lived there. From an archaeological perspective, deep time represents a period of at least 32,000 years. The ongoing dynamic relationship of Gunditjmara and their land is nowadays carried by knowledge systems retained through oral transmission and continuity of cultural practice.</p>",

Serra do Mar and Ilha Grande Bay is home to an impressive diversity of animal species, some of which are threatened, such as the jaguar (<em>Panthera onca</em>), the white-lipped peccary (<em>Tayassu pecari</em>) and several primate species, including the Southern Muriqui (<em>Brachyteles arachnoides</em>), which are emblematic of the property. In the late 17th century, Paraty was the end-point of the <em>Caminho do Ouro</em> (Gold Route), along which gold was shipped to Europe. Its port also served as an entry point for tools and African slaves, sent to work in the mines. A defence system was built to protect the wealth of the port and the town.\u00a0The historic centre of Paraty has retained its 18th<sup> </sup>century plan and much of its colonial architecture dating from the 18th<sup> </sup>and early 19th centuries.</span></p>",

I would say that the town is rustic and it could be but it is rather neglected. There is garbage and bad smells on every corner. The signage is terrible and is in very poor condition. Basic products in supermarkets, little variety. Argentines: bring salt because the quality of the local salt is terrible (coarsely ground and does not dissolve).\n\nSuper safe and laid back.

Markets, shops, residences and temples built along the main streets have uniform facades. The city's urban planning shows an exchange of ideas from ancient Hindu and early modern Mughal as well as Western cultures. The grid plan is a model that prevails in the West, while the organization of the different city sectors (chowkris) refers to traditional Hindu concepts. Designed to be a commercial capital, the city has maintained its local commercial, artisanal and cooperative traditions to this day.",

The sanctuary was developed over a period of more than 600 years, primarily in a Baroque style, and illustrates a European tradition of creating\u00a0<em>Sacri Monti</em>\u00a0(sacred mountains), promoted by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent in the 16th\u00a0century, in reaction to the Protestant Reformation. The Bom Jesus ensemble is centred on a\u00a0<em>Via Crucis</em>\u00a0that leads up the western slope of the mount. It includes a series of chapels that house sculptures evoking the Passion of Christ, as well as fountains, allegorical sculptures and formal gardens. The\u00a0<em>Via Crucis</em> culminates at the church, which was built between 1784 and 1811. The granite buildings have whitewashed plaster fa\u00e7ades, framed by exposed stonework. The celebrated Stairway of the Five Senses, with its walls, steps, fountains, statues and other ornamental elements, is the most emblematic Baroque work within the property. They are framed by lush woodland and embraced by a picturesque park that, masterfully set on the rugged hill, highly contributes to the landscape value of the ensemble.</p>",

Together they bear testimony to a culture of marine hunter-gatherers who resided in the arid and hostile northern coast of the Atacama Desert in northernmost Chile from approximately 5450 BCE to 890 BCE. The property presents the oldest known archaeological evidence of the artificial mummification of bodies with cemeteries that contain both artificially mummified bodies and some that were preserved due to environmental conditions. Over time, the Chinchorro perfected complex mortuary practices, whereby they systematically dismembered and reassembled bodies of deceased men, women and children of the entire social spectrum to create \u201cartificial\u201d mummies. These mummies possess material, sculptural, and aesthetic qualities that are presumed to reflect the fundamental role of the dead in Chinchorro society. Tools made of mineral and plant materials as well as simple instruments made of bone and shells that enabled an intensive exploitation of marine resources, have been found in the property which bears a unique testimony to the complex spirituality of the Chinchorro culture.</p>",

They present an interpretation of an architectural style thought to have originated around the 14th\u00a0century in the town of Djenn\u00e9, then part of the Empire of Mali, which prospered from the trade in gold and salt across the Sahara to North Africa. Particularly from the 16th\u00a0century, the style spread south from the desert regions into the Sudanese savannah, becoming lower and developing stouter buttresses in response to the wetter climate. The mosques are the best conserved of 20 such edifices that remain in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, where hundreds existed early last century. The mosques\u2019 distinctive Sudanese style, specific to the savannah region of West Africa, developed between the 17th\u00a0and 19th\u00a0centuries as traders and scholars spread south from the Empire of Mali, extending the trans-Saharan mercantile routes into the forest area. They present highly important testimonies to the trans-Saharan trade that facilitated the expansion of Islam and Islamic culture and reflect a fusion of Islamic and local architectural forms in a highly distinctive style that has persisted over time.\u00a0</p>",

Its grandeur is apparent from afar, with towering minarets that grace the skyline, offering a symbolic connection between earth and the heavens. The mosque's design seamlessly blends contemporary aesthetics with traditional Islamic motifs, creating a harmonious space that invites both worshippers and admirers alike.\n\nUpon approaching, the intricately adorned entrance gate welcomes visitors with a sense of reverence and tranquility. The facade, adorned with intricate calligraphy and mosaic artistry, tells stories of faith and unity.

Built in white limestone dressed blocks at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, it was designed by engineer Louis de Foix and remodelled by engineer Joseph Teule\u0300re in the late 18th century. A masterpiece of maritime signalling, Cordouan\u2019s monumental tower is decorated with pilasters, columns modillions and gargoyles. It embodies the great stages of the architectural and technological history of lighthouses and was built with the ambition of continuing the tradition of famous beacons of antiquity, illustrating the art of building lighthouses in a period of renewed navigation, when beacons played an important role as territorial markers and as instruments of safety. Finally, the increase of its height, in the late 18th century, and the changes to its light chamber, attest to the progress of science and technology of the period. Its architectural forms drew inspiration from ancient models, Renaissance Mannerism and the specific architectural language of France\u2019s engineering school\u00a0<em>E\u0301cole des Ponts et Chausse\u0301es</em>.",

    "short_description": "<p>The Mediterranean city Nice, near the Italian border, bears witness to the evolution of the winter climatic resort due to the city\u2019s mild climate and seaside location at the foot of the Alps. From the middle of the 18th\u00a0century, Nice attracted an increasing number of aristocratic and upper-class families, mainly British, who took to spending their winters there. In 1832, Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Savoy-Piedmont-Sardinia, adopted a regulatory urban plan aiming to make it attractive to foreigners. Shortly thereafter, the\u00a0Camin dei Inglesi, a modest 2-metre wide path along the sea shore, was expanded to become a prestigious promenade, known as the\u00a0Promenade des Anglais\u00a0after the city was ceded to France in 1860. Over the next century, an increasing number of winter residents from other countries, notably Russia, flocked to the city driving successive phases of development of new areas next to the old medieval town. The diverse cultural influences of the winter residents and the desire to make the most of the climatic conditions and scenery of the place, shaped the urban planning and eclectic architectural styles of those areas, contributing to the city\u2019s renown as a cosmopolitan winter resort.\u00a0</p>",

The buildings of the colony were created by its artist members as experimental early modernist living and working environments. The colony was expanded during successive international exhibitions in 1901, 1904, 1908 and 1914. Today, it offers a testimony to early modern architecture, urban planning and landscape design, all of which were influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and the Vienna Secession. The serial property consists of two component parts including 23 elements, such as the Wedding Tower (1908), the Exhibition Hall (1908), the Plane Tree Grove (1833, 1904-14), the Russian Chapel of St. Maria Magdalena (1897-99), the Lily Basin, the Gottfried Schwab Memorial (1905), the Pergola and Garden (1914), the \u201cSwan Temple\u201d Garden Pavilion (1914), the Ernst Ludwig Fountain, and the 13 houses and artists\u2019 studios that were built for the Darmstadt Artists\u2019 Colony and for the international exhibitions.

It is the main Shiva temple in a walled complex built during the Kakatiyan period (1123\u20131323 CE) under rulers Rudradeva and Recharla Rudra. Construction of the sandstone temple began in 1213 CE and is believed to have continued over some 40 years. The building features decorated beams and pillars of carved granite and dolerite with a distinctive and pyramidal Vimana (horizontally stepped tower) made of lightweight porous bricks, so-called \u2018floating bricks\u2019, which reduced the weight of the roof structures. The temple\u2019s sculptures of high artistic quality illustrate regional dance customs and Kakatiyan culture. Located at the foothills of a forested area and amidst agricultural fields, close to the shores of the Ramappa Cheruvu, a Kakatiya-built water reservoir, the choice of setting for the edifice followed the ideology and practice sanctioned in dharmic texts that temples are to be constructed to form an integral part of a natural setting, including hills, forests, springs, streams, lakes, catchment areas, and agricultural lands.",

Its construction involved extensive mountain cutting in some areas, while the rugged terrain in others dictated the construction of 174 large bridges, 186 small bridges and 224 tunnels, including 11 spiral tunnels.

Nevertheless, the frescos maintain a unity of style and content. They include Giotto\u2019s Scrovegni Chapel fresco cycle, considered to have marked the beginning of a revolutionary development in the history of mural painting, as well as other fresco cycles of different artists, namely Guariento di Arpo, Giusto de\u2019 Menabuoi, Altichiero da Zevio, Jacopo Avanzi and Jacopo da Verona. As a group, these fresco cycles illustrate how, over the course of a century, fresco art developed along a new creative impetus and understanding of spatial representation.",

This small but breathtaking chapel is home to Giotto\u2019s frescoes, painted between 1303 and 1305, which revolutionized Renaissance art with their realism, depth, and emotional storytelling.\n\nOpening Times & Tickets\n\u2022\tOpen daily from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM (last entry at 6:20 PM).\n\u2022\tTickets cost 14\u20ac for adults, 5\u20ac for children (under 6 free), and include entry to the Eremitani Museum next door.\n\u2022\tAdvance booking is essential as entry is limited to small groups to preserve the frescoes.\n\nWhy You Should Visit\n\nThe chapel\u2019s fresco cycle depicts scenes from the Life of the Virgin Mary and Christ, culminating in the dramatic Last Judgment. Giotto\u2019s mastery of light, perspective, and human expression brings the stories to life in a way that was groundbreaking for the time. One of the most famous scenes, The Lamentation, captures raw human emotion with stunning detail.\n\nBefore entering, visitors watch a short film about the chapel\u2019s history in a climate-controlled waiting area, designed to protect the fragile frescoes. The visit itself lasts 15 minutes, but every second inside this masterpiece is unforgettable.\n\nLocated in the heart of Padua, the Scrovegni Chapel is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for art lovers and history enthusiasts alike. A true gem of the Italian Renaissance \u2013 5/5!",

These portico ensembles are considered to be the most representative among city\u2019s porticoes, which cover a total stretch of 62 km. Some of the porticoes are built of wood, others of stone or brick, as well as reinforced concrete, covering roads, squares, paths and walkways, either on one or both sides of a street. The property includes porticoed buildings that do not form a structural continuum with other buildings and therefore are not part of a comprehensive covered walkway or passage. The porticoes are appreciated as sheltered walkways and prime locations for merchant activities. In the 20th\u00a0century, the use of concrete allowed the replacement of the traditional vaulted arcades with new building possibilities and a new architectural language for the porticoes emerged, as exemplified in the Barca district. Together, the selected porticoes reflect different typologies, urban and social functions and chronological phases. Defined as private property for public use, the porticoes have become an expression and element of Bologna\u2019s urban identity.\u00a0</p>",

The site\u2019s urban core includes approximately 650 significant historic buildings exhibiting a blend of European Art Nouveau and Neo-Colonial styles combined with local traditions.

The site includes a triple-walled hilltop complex, known as the Fortified Temple, two building complexes called Observatory and Administrative Centre, a line of 13 cuboidal towers stretching along the ridge of a hill, and the Cerro Mucho Malo that complements the Thirteen Towers as a natural marker. The ceremonial centre was probably dedicated to a solar cult, and the presence of an observation point on either side of the north-south line of the Thirteen Towers allows the observation both of the solar rising and setting points throughout the whole year. The site shows great innovation by using the solar cycle and an artificial horizon to mark the solstices, the equinoxes, and every other date within the year with a precision of 1-2 days. It is thus a testimony of the culmination of a long historical evolution of astronomical practices in the Casma Valley.\u00a0</p>",

The site exhibits a complex combination of geological, oceanographic and climatologic conditions that have led to the development of coastal diverse sedimentary systems. Each component represents one of four tidal flat subtypes (estuarine type, open embayed type, archipelago type and semi-enclosed type). The site hosts high levels of biodiversity, with reports of 2,150 species of flora and fauna, including 22 globally threatened or near-threatened species. It is home to 47 endemic and five endangered marine invertebrate species besides a total of 118 migratory bird species for which the site provides critical habitats. Endemic fauna includes Mud Octopuses (Octopus minor), and deposit feeders like Japanese Mud Crabs (Macrophthalmus japonica), Fiddler Crabs (Uca lactea), and Polychaetes (bristle worms), Stimpson\u2019s Ghost Crabs (Ocypode stimpsoni), Yellow Sea Sand Snails (Umbonium thomasi), , as well as various suspension feeders like clams. The site demonstrates the link between geodiversity and biodiversity, and demonstrates the dependence of cultural diversity and human activity on the natural environment.</p>",

As Alburnus Maior, it was the site of extensive gold-mining during the Roman Empire. Over 166 years starting in 106 CE, the Romans extracted some 500 tonnes of gold from the site developing highly engineered works, different types of galleries totalling 7km and a number of waterwheels in four underground localities chosen for their high-grade ore. Wax\u2010coated wooden writing tablets have provided detailed legal, socio\u2010economic, demographic and linguistic information about the Roman mining activities, not just in Alburnus Maior but also across the wider Dacian province. The site demonstrates a fusion of imported Roman mining technology with locally developed techniques, unknown elsewhere from such an early era. Mining on the site was also carried out, albeit to a lesser extent, between medieval times and the modern era. The later extractive works surround and cut across the Roman galleries. The ensemble is set in an agro-pastoral landscape which largely reflects the structures of the communities that supported the mines between the 18th\u00a0and early 20th\u00a0centuries.",

Dating back 7,000 years, this site offers a rare glimpse into the past, with thousands of petroglyphs revealing the daily lives, beliefs and survival strategies of ancient Arab communities. Long before modern trade routes crossed the desert, travelers and tribes left their marks on these stones, depicting camels, ostriches and even animals long extinct in the region, such as lions and ibex, hinting at a more fertile environment millennia ago.\nHistorians believe Bi'r Hima's location was a critical point along ancient trade routes, where caravans carrying incense, spices and precious goods from southern Arabia to the Mediterranean coast likely stopped. The inscriptions here, in early scripts such as Musnad and Aramaic-Nabataean, tell of a cultural crossroads, with influences from southern Arabian, Nabataean, and early Arabic traditions. Some even suggest that Bi'r Hima was a meeting place for various tribes and travellers, with carvings that may have commemorated agreements, rituals or legends shared over a distance.\nAs a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Bi'r Hima stands as an open-air archive, capturing the vibrant history of Arabia. Each inscription, from religious symbols to the earliest records of social life, is a testament to the resilience and diversity of the people who navigated this rugged landscape, creating a rich cultural tapestry that is only now being fully appreciated by historians and archaeologists.\n\nCultural Landscapes\n\nRock art of Bi'r Hima and Najran area, SAUDI ARABIA\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSite:\u00a0Bi'r Hima rock art and cultural landscape of Najran area\n\nKeywords:\u00a0Saudi Arabia, Cultural Landscape, Rock Art, rock art, paintings, carvings, petroglyphs, Bi'r Hima, Najran, Okhdood.\n\n1.

The settlement of Najran was an important center along the Incense Route. Caravans from Yemen passed through Najran before heading north. The western branch was destined for Egypt, the Levant, Greece and Rome, while the eastern branch headed towards Mesopotamia. The peak of the incense trade occurred between 800 B.C. and 600 AD. The ancient citadel of al Okhdood, located at the southwestern edge of the modern city of Najran, was built in the 7th-6th century BC. A depiction of a robustly built horse, similar in shape to the Nisean breed of the 6th century BC. used by the Persians, and a serpent are engraved on one of the large building blocks along the avenue entering the citadel. Bi'r Hima, historically known for its famous wells, is located about 30 km northeast of Najran. It is a complex made up of rock art and archaeological settlements. in The Wadi and Jebel Labyrinth is home to hundreds of examples of petroglyphs, including some large, complex panels compiled with images from multiple periods. Battle scenes with knights and infantry wielding various weapons are the most common. Ostriches, domestic cattle, camels and date palms are also common. Large human figures are known from some locations in the Bi'r Hima/Najran region, as are numerous \"Alliah or Al-Lat goddesses\" shown adjacent to battle scenes.",

The architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik contributed to this transformation with his personal, profoundly human vision for the city, based on an architectural dialogue with the older city while serving the needs of emerging modern 20th\u00a0century society. The property consists of a series of public spaces (squares, parks, streets, promenades, bridges) and public institutions (national library, churches, markets, funerary complex) that were sensitively integrated into the pre-existing urban, natural and cultural context and contributed to the city\u2019s new identity. This highly contextual and human-scale urbanistic approach, as well as Ple\u010dnik\u2019s distinctive architectural idiom, stand apart from the other predominant modernist principles of his time. It is an exceptional case of creating public spaces, buildings and green areas according to the vision of a single architect within a limited time, the limited space of an existing city, and with relatively limited resources.</p>",

    "short_description": "Located at the urban heart of Madrid, the 200-hectare cultural landscape evolved since the creation of the tree-lined Paseo del Prado avenue, a prototype of the Hispanic alameda, in the 16th century. The avenue features major fountains, notably the Fuente de Cibeles and the Fuente de Neptuno, and the Plaza de Cibeles, an iconic symbol of the city, surrounded by prestigious buildings. The site embodies a new idea of urban space and development from the enlightened absolutist period of the 18th century. Buildings dedicated to the arts and sciences join others in the site that are devoted to industry, healthcare and research. Collectively, they illustrate the aspiration for a utopian society during the height of the Spanish Empire. The 120-hectare Jardines del Buen Retiro (Garden of Pleasant Retreat), a remnant of the 17th-century Buen Retiro Palace, constitutes the largest part of the property displaying different gardening styles from the 19th century to the present. The site also houses the terraced Royal Botanical Garden and the largely residential neighbourhood of Barrio Jer\u00f3nimos with its rich variety of 19th- and 20th-century buildings that include cultural venues.",

An extraordinary urban environment, where culture, science and nature have coexisted since the mid-16th century.\n\nThe Landscape of Light is the first property to hold such distinction in the city of Madrid, and the fifth in the Community, along with the Monastery of El Escorial, the historic center of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, the cultural landscape of Aranjuez and the Hayedo de Montejo.\n\nThe Prado promenade is the first of the European urban tree-lined promenades. The citizens used it since the 15th century as a place for recreation and Philip II was in charge of refurbishing and beautifying it with trees and fountains. It was during the Enlightenment period, specifically under the reign of Charles III, when the most important urban intervention took place in this enclave, which would become a model for many Spanish and Latin American cities.\n\nA special and unique feature is the incorporation of sciences into the urban landscape of the area with the creation of the Cabinet and Academy of Natural Sciences, today the Prado Museum, the Royal Botanical Garden, from where the botanical expeditions that explored overseas territories departed. and they gathered an incredible scientific treasure that is preserved in their archive and the Royal Astronomical Observatory, located on the so-called Hill of Sciences. Incorporations closely linked to the pedagogical spirit of citizen education characteristic of the time.\n\nThe exhibition is made up of information and images of its most notable aspects \u2013 nature, history, art and an urban model of international projection \u2013 through panels, maps, a model, interactive and audiovisual stalls that illustrate the values \u200b\u200bthat have helped it to be declared a World Heritage Site. A dynamic place whose objective is to serve as a springboard for the public who wants to explore, get to know and enjoy one of the most relevant areas of Madrid. For this purpose, it has plans of the area in various languages.",

Maybe that's just my experience or I didn't do enough homework prior to the trip but it wasn't as easy or permissible as I expected. You'll probably need a guide and to hire a 4 x 4 if you don't already have one. But well worth it. Butterflies, monkeys, bird life that we saw was worth it. The lake was magnificent! So scenic.

We're not avid birdwatchers, really hoped to spot creepy crawlers and some mammals.\n\nIt seems that the campsite is absolutely required to really enjoy the park to it's fullest. Most mammals come out later in the evening, so you would be able to spot several animals around the camping area. I've heard porcupines and even bears visiting the vicinity of the camp site.\n\nDuring our morning safari we did not see a lot of wildlife, only a family of macaques and luckily one great Hornbill. During the nature walk I hoped to spot some lizards, insects and snakes, but we didn't really spot anything. I am sure the park is abundant with wildlife, but it may only come to life after sunset.",

The earliest layers of the Early Uruk period are characterized by adobe houses from the first half of the 4th\u00a0millennium BCE.

Considerable evidence also testifies to the Early Bronze Age period, most prominently identified by the Royal Tomb complex. The archaeological stratigraphy then extends to the Paleo-Assyrian and Hittite periods, including Neo-Hittite levels. The site illustrates the processes which led to the emergence of a State society in the Near East and a sophisticated bureaucratic system that predates writing. Exceptional metal objects and weapons have been excavated at the site, among them the earliest swords so far known in the world, which suggests the beginning of forms of organized combat as the prerogative of an elite, who exhibited them as instruments of their new political power.\u00a0</p>",

The serial property comprises six components each encompassing relict quarries and mines, archaeological sites related to slate industrial processing, historical settlements, both living and relict, historic gardens and grand country houses, ports, harbours and quays, and railway and road systems illustrating the functional and social linkages of the relict slate industrial landscape. The property was internationally significant not only for the export of slates, but also for the export of technology and skilled workers from the 1780s to the early 20th\u00a0century. It played a leading role in the field and constituted a model for other slate quarries in different parts of the world.

All of these towns developed around natural mineral water springs. They bear witness to the international European spa culture that developed from the early 18th\u00a0century to the 1930s, leading to the emergence of grand international resorts that impacted urban typology around ensembles of spa buildings such as the\u00a0kurhaus\u00a0and\u00a0kursaal\u00a0(buildings and rooms dedicated to therapy), pump rooms, drinking halls, colonnades and galleries designed to harness the natural mineral water resources and to allow their practical use for bathing and drinking. Related facilities include gardens, assembly rooms, casinos, theatres, hotels and villas, as well as spa-specific support infrastructure. These ensembles are all integrated into an overall urban context that includes a carefully managed recreational and therapeutic environment in a picturesque landscape. Together, these sites embody the significant interchange of human values and developments in medicine, science and balneology.",

Together they bear witness to a 19th\u00a0century experiment in social reform, an effort to alleviate urban poverty by establishing agricultural colonies in remote locations. Established in 1818, Frederiksoord (the Netherlands) is the earliest of these colonies and home to the original headquarters of the Society of Benevolence, an association which aimed to reduce poverty at the national level. Other components of the property are the colonies of Wilhelminaoord and Veenhuizen, in the Netherlands, and Wortel in Belgium. As the colonies\u2019 small farms yielded insufficient revenues, the Society of Benevolence sought other sources of revenue, contracting with the State to settle orphans, soon followed by beggars and vagrants, leading to the creation of \u201cunfree\u201d colonies, such as Veenhuizen, with large dormitory type structures and larger centralized farms for them to work under the supervision of guards. The colonies were designed as panoptic settlements along orthogonal lines. They feature residential buildings, farm houses, churches and other communal facilities. At their peak in the mid-19th\u00a0century, over 11,000 people lived in such colonies in the Netherlands. In Belgium their number peaked at 6,000 in 1910.\u00a0</p>",
